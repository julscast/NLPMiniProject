"Hey Goodhumans, we hope you enjoy this episode and we hope it sparks meaningful & productive dialogue in your lives, as well as here in the comments. To keep up with what we're doing and for episode sneak peeks, follow us on Instagram! https://instagram.com/jubileemedia"
I feel like they should've found a girl who went along with men's rights or a man who was a feminist
"Men’s rights vs feminism vs Derrick

You decide."
the other guys were probably like “godamn derrick quit making us look bad”
the fact that derrick was raised by a single mother and still acted this like this is genuinley sad
"I can't believe ""Men and woman are different but equal"" is an actual prompt. Like that is BASIC humanity 😭😭."
"The two guys on the sides of Derrick are just like: crap, this dude is ruining our whole argument"
"question: men=women?
derrick:  hmmmm, child..."
Zach was the most understanding and overall best communicator on the men’s side. i really love the way he wants to learn and actually debate rather than just go against because of his own beliefs
"Notice that every time the women ask actual questions, they're only addressing Zach and Kursat. You don't need to think too hard to realize why."
Derrick: speaks      Everyone: 😐
The fact that Derrick would like to live how we used to decades ago says a LOT about him………😬 So many wrong things were happening so openly back then.
I feel like if it was zach and bea themselves this wouldve been a real calm and easy vid
"There's feminists, there's male activists, and then theres derrick."
imagine having a kid just so it becomes a Derrick
zach & Bea asked the question that was the most helpful  and seemed to genuinely wanna understand each other. they simply was the most helpful in this discussion and would love to see them just sit down
I feel for Alyshea and I hope she’s okay and getting the support she needs for all the wrong done to her. It’s hard to have to be strong constantly
"This comment section taught us: it's not Men vs Women, it's Men and Women vs Derrick"
"There's 3 groups in this discussion
1. Men Rights
2. Feminists
3. Derrick"
why can’t we just support both men and women at the same time. As a guy myself ik there’s many instances where men are unfairly treated and there’s many instances where women are unfairly treated. We don’t gotta prioritize one over the other.
"I think having an Incel to represent Men's rights activism, isn't exactly the best thing."
Jubilee pathetic
Jubilee having that incel on was a mistake. That kind of man is an issue. The other 2 however have a good grip on men’s rights but you should also have had a black man on there because there are men’s rights issues in the black community that should have been brought to the light.
when one of the feminist said she would laugh at mens rights thats honestly disgusting that just shows how toxic feminism is
You literallly picked men that knows nothing
" @DreamlandRoses  Hello! I believe it's not just about the incel, but the fact that there is no man who is a feminist or no woman who is a man's rights activist(in the above group, that's upsetting)!"
" @agentpiggles6685  probably bc men already have all the rights they can possibly acquire, there's still women who aren't even allowed to do something as simple as vote"
"The fact that you're willing to have incels on and mainstream their abhorrent views makes you bad humans. Once could be a mistake or a misunderstanding, now you know you're just doing it for the controversy. You should feel bad."
" Silviu Florin True! let's keep in mind the fact that when someone is given 'extra' in a society, it is believed that the person lacks and this giving more which the right activists are against would never stop unless the group
gains the status of equal then the 'power' would never be shifted rather distributed!"
Hi Jubilee is it possible to have English subtitles? Sometimes I struggle to understand and I cannot enjoy the content. Love your videos by the way ^^
Derrick lacked enough empathy to understand the other group. Should have gotten a dude who could relate to being attacked.
"Gamers vs. Millennials
Do video games cause violent behaviour"
 @remembertoloveyourselftoda4015 yourself  hello! you can try clicking the subtitle button on the bottom right corner of your play screen they are pretty accurate : >
Bea🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
 @Ouchie_bruh  you're right! Eventhough there are automatic there are quite accurate^^
thanks
 @ms.flowers1049  Oh! that was hard! let's just not create further divisions and stereotypes there are enough that we must overcome already! : >
 @bethteklu3194  what about the legal bias with custody and such?
Jubilee why would you use a title that is already biased
"I saw a suggestion for 'Incels vs Feminists'. Probably liking the idea but not wanting a bloodbath, Jubilee had to change the title around a little."
" @Overused_Toothbrush  Yeah, from his answer I'm fairly certain he doesn't really know what empathy is"
"You seriously brought the incel back as a representative of the men's rights movement? Like I get it, you could be an incel AND a men's rights advocate but the fact that we know the person is an incel and the already negative asociation with that will carry over into this conversation thereby poisoning the well."
Lol nope
"Notice how after every other Middle Ground episode, both sides immediately hug each other or shake their hands. After this one, the dude literally had to tell them to shake hands."
pls do Ben Shapiro vs. 3 femminists
Best middle ground yet
"Wow. I came fully expecting me to side more with the mens rights guys. Half way through, and im not feeling that way"
"You usually do a good job of representing communities and movements the best way possible. This time, not so much. The feminists are staying on topic and seem to all genuinely believe in the equality of the sexes, as feminists should. On the mra side, however, there is too much talk of ideology and whether one is surperior to the other. The mra movement does believe in the equality of the sexes, but aknowlages that each of the sexes has their problems that need dealing with, and serves to draw attention to the problems men have to deal with, as nobody else will. These problems include disproportionately male suicides, criminal justice bias, family court bias, overrepresentation of men in very dangerous proffessions with subsequent workplace deaths, and many many more. There is only one person here who tries to talk on these points, which is what the conversation needs to be about. That, and of course equally important, the actual problems the feminists are trying to solve on their side. And most importantly of all, the question that should be the absolute biggest point of middle ground between these two movements: ""Is it possible that both movements get their will at the same time"", to which the answer is yes. Anyone who disaggrees are referring to the disingenous side of the movement they're addressing, or they're disingenous themselves. 

Thank you for reading, and I apolagize for any bad english. It is not my first language."
 @superskullmaster  I'd much rather know the black communities issues than Derek the Incel lmfao. Derek brought nothing serious to the table while the black community has many specific issues.
"I think it could be really interesting to revisit this topic again next season with an all male episode and an all female episode, because I feel this episode kind of lingered on man vs woman rights while feminism is actually about equality for all"
"1, having an incel did not help. Although not everyone thinks the same, having him as a representative for men’s rights was not a good choice. 2, for any male, female or whatever the heck you are, hear me out. You need to stop judging situations solely off of whether you experienced them or not. That’s not how injustices work. They target people. And if you’re not a target who are you to say it doesn’t happen or exist? If that’s the case, then why do we still have these situations happening repeatedly? Just be aware that not everyone’s experiences are the same, and just because you’re not targeted DOES NOT mean others aren’t."
"@Jubilee I usually enjoy these videos. Why invite an extremist from MRA but not from Feminists? We all know ""feminists"" who want more power as a reperations rather than equality. The MRAs besides the incel, would also probably be considered feminists, or vote that way politically because politically they wanted equality. Feminism is NOT equal to just women. This was a group of an Incel, 5 politically aligned feminists, 2 of which were social feminists wanting to change the upbringing of men (who were raised poorly if they're treating women disrespectfully). Being a man is about respect and chivalry [not just towards women]. Going the extra mile not because women are incapable but bc you respect them. Some of y'all never listened to Pac and it shows."
Min Suga's Natural Hair Is Daebak when we discuss equality and rights. It means taking into consideration those differences until equality is reached (everyone being able to watch the game) not that everyone should be treated the same.
"Agent piggles Are you going to ignore the two other feminists that listened to literally everything the men said, and also advocated for their rights as well?"
Raverto most of the ones who do stand for feminism. Men’s rights are being encompassed in feminism it’s not just about women
"Kursat Christoff Pekgoz Holy crap! I’m so sorry. Just as viewed in this video, there’s toxic masculinity all over. But not too many people are aware of toxic femininity. There are a lot of stories like this and it’s important to hear out the men who are targeted by sexism and injustices as well. I hope you and other real activists help spread the message of prejudices, and spread equality. I wish for the best!"
Please could you do a middle ground episode on Brexit? 🙏
"Jubilee 


Great episode. I hate the word “intersectional feminism” just say feminism ffs. Intersectional feminism IS feminism anything else isn’t"
And I bet none of these “men’s rights activist” don’t do anything for all the unarmed black and brown men targeted by white law enforcers...I guess if white boys aren’t also affected by the problem then it’s not a “men’s rights issue”
"acemanEpic 

Funny how in your list of problems you didn’t include how black and brown men are unfairly targeted by police. This is why no one will ever take your movement seriously because it doesn’t include situations that exclusively affect men of other races, you only care about problems unless it affects white men too"
"Props to the casting staff! This is a diverse panel, we're glad to see it."
"Kayla O. I think she used the term “ intersectional feminism” as a clarification for the people who think that she only cares about women. But I do agree with you except for the part about one type of feminism. There are two main types of feminism: erratic feminism and feminism. Erratic feminists are the ones who spoil it for everyone else. Most men like to judge all feminist based off of erratic feminism and the fact that they have never experienced situations even though they are not targets of those injustices. I definitely don’t think Derek the incel cares about anyone except for straight, Cis, whit men, but the other activists could very much stand with them."
 @bethteklu3194  yes but let's be honest you dont care about those women who cant vote and are using this men have privilege excuse to bash men as a group.
"This was an interesting one! It would be great if this topic could be redone but with participants who aren't activists; just to get more, different ideas on the table, because I felt like the two sides were radically oppposed to one another (I mean that is what i expected with ""men's rights vs. feminists, lol) as opposed to  perspectives that vary from person to person being brought to the conversation. 


We all love Middle Ground! Keep up the good work! <3"
"I mean I hear many white feminists (not all but many) talking about how black and brown women are unfairly treated all the time, never have I ever heard white mras ever mention the mistreatment black and brown men get by the system. If you want your movement to be taken seriously you need to realize that there are problems that affect other men that need to be addressed, not just the issues that affect your privileged demographic"
Dragon Fire ☝️👏👏👏 agreed
"You put links up for this argument, but not in the flat earth debate. Lame. (Derrick was wrong/trolling[i think])"
Would be interested if you brought people like Jordan Peterson or Sargon of Akkad vs Anita Sarkisian or Zoe Quinn. Wouldn’t THAT be a sigh.
"Agent piggles 

Im sorry but what rights do men have to fight for ?"
Irish-Americans vs Irish people from Ireland ? Since so many Americans claim to be irish ( I'm from Ireland lol)
"Would you tell Zach I know a male midwife, and he knows other male midwives. Its only about 1% of midwives but they do exist."
Why did you guys bring an incel into what could have been an interesting conversation between men and women?
Agent piggles the double standard is real.
"I honestly was expecting that the outcome of this episode would be something uplifting like both sides gonna acknowledges the concerns and facts of discrimination for both genders. Maybe end up with the idea that no matter the gender, discrimination should never happen, a cause for all human being.

But no. Sadly. I believe it has to do with the compositions."
"John Doe 

“You used a bunch of incels”

They literally just have one incel there"
For real you should of had a woman on the men's right side and a man on the feminism side. I'm a woman and a mother and I am all for the men's right side. Would be a good way to show each side that it's not just men think this way and women think this way.
" @Ouchie_bruh  but there is such thing as Allies, most ""male feminists"" are called Allies to the feminist movement. You can tell that the Incel didn't exactly have it right when trying to answer the questions to the best of his ability"
"Jubilee please take this video down. A whole mess... a whole waste. If you do decide to do it again, get people who can represent each side effectively. Yes... BOTH sides were lacking."
@Layla Petes not really. Only the Incel was the Incel. The other two actually had a good grip on the concept of male rights but they weren't exactly there.
" @QuinGuitardotcom  parents consent to your mutilation at birth.just sayin, white boy."
@Layla Petes ok Boomer that's like saying all Karen's are bad because they want to shout and scream at the manager
I appreciate what you are trying to do with these videos.  I'm just worried we might be past that time.
 @jomaldotco  As I watched I kept wishing I was there.  Somebody would have cried.
I wonder how many thumbs down you got for cherry picking?
"@Min Suga's Natural Hair Is Daebak By equity do you mean equality of outcomes? Because making equal outcomes is destructive to people and there freedoms. People value differing things and will therefore work at differing levels in differing fields. Equity in my mind leads to Gulags, Cultural revolution and the Killing fields of Cambodia."
 @TheBaddestWitchOnTheBlock  universal male suffrage predated female suffrage by 1 to 2 decades.  Most men had no power. It wasn't woman dueling by the millions in WW1 and 2.
Incels and mra's arent the same thing at all
"Derrik is not a MRA, Incells and MRAs believe different things."
I knew that was Zach Hing in the thumbnail 🤣👏🙌  his videos are very insightful. I love listening to them while I draw or am on my way to work
Wtf why are you putting links to one sides argument in the description. Thought you guys where impartial.
"Ok, so....every video I have watched from you guys I always thought you tried to be fair and free of bias...not editing or setting things up to make one side look worse than the other ...Except for today...the fact the you thought it was appropriate to put a incel in this conversation makes me feel that the production purposely set up he Men's Right Activist...being that you know that, that's a stereotype of MRA's...that their just angry men, that can't get laid...That was entirely inappropriate...if you want to have an incel middle ground that should have been a completely separate episode....There are so many intelligent well spoken Men's Rights Activist and you decided to take one of those spots to put an Incel in...who took up entirely way too much talking space and invalidated alot of what the more well rounded talking points that the other two gentlemen made...or you edited out more of what the other two men said and decided to keep more of what the incel guy said in....this was a very difficult episode to watch because of this...please re-do this topic and do better next time."
Don Cheeto you couldn’t have said it any better . Preach!!!
Jubilee  next video: effeminates vs traditional men
1:31 Lol she says that she doesn’t dislike men because she ALSO plays video games and do sports.
" @kaylao.3326  Personally, I can't see the point of men's rights movement. I doubt anyone including yourself would take a movement with white men in seriously, has you would class it to be sexist and / or racist."
"Jubilee, I love and adore your work BUT having an incel was a very very very bad idea. I even think that it was very disrespectful for the women in the video and even in the studio. Having a person who is clearly a discriminative piece of sh*t is not okay."
"beth so if I said I would laugh at your rights, you wouldn’t be offended? I laugh at you for making such an ignorant comment and supporting someone that says they laugh at another’s beliefs just because they can’t relate..."
"I would like this to be an ongoing series/conversation there’s a lot to be said and I’m actually glad this one didn’t have a happy ending as it is exemplary that it’s a bigger conversation with many distinct positions and views even just on a spectrum of male advocacy to female advocacy. Maybe you guys could include more people and showcase more perspectives next time, if there is one(hopefully)."
"Kursat Christoff Pekgoz What do you think about The Red Pill documentary made by Cassie Jaye? Also, I think Jubilee is clearly biased against mens issues here."
"I'm a Feminist AND a men's rights advocate, a combination that most people claim to not understand or just straight-up hate. 1. Biologically, females and males are different when it comes to estrogen and testosterone levels. Besides hormones, people of every gender deserve to be treated with the same level of respect. 2. Toxic masculinity and toxic femininity are big problems. 3. Females have advantages that males don't have, and vice versa.  The Left seem to forget about things like the fact that females were not drafted during the Vietnam War and, even now, can say no if their number were to come up.  4. Barely anyone seems to understand my values.  It's mind-boggling to say the least since my ""platform"" or whatever is for everyone to feel like they matter.  I don't know how to make it simpler - I really don't.  5. Everyone should respect and love their fellow human. We don't need to hurt one another.  6. I feel empathy for everyone who is hurting."
"what you need to do is invite a generation who has already been through this, the younger generation is weighed down by advertisement and social stigma to be honest about their true beliefs. 

The lady talking about tampon tax is a clear example. 
Men having to fight and die in wars without a choice is patriarchy?"
Having derrick on the show was not a good idea
Kursat's position and his statements are the same as mine. He articulates his position and thoughts and ideas very well.
" @QuinGuitardotcom  The Red Pill changed my life. It's what made me a ""Feminist Men's Rights advocate"".  I already knew about the issues in the men's community and was deeply concerned  about them (I have a personal connection to a man who was severely discriminated against), but this documentary was what officially made me change my ""stance"".  And it is very difficult to find someone who'll support a person who ""goes both ways"", let me tell ya."
" @David-Borromeo  Derrick unfortunately came out of a very sexist environment where he was taught that he has to be the strong one. He needs therapy.  You and the third man came to the Femists with facts about how men are battling a shitstorm too but he only brought to the table the harmful stuff he was ""taught"" by his environment. He's not ready to push for either - let alone both, as I do - sides."
"SLiM M I’m happy you watched it with an open mind, we need to keep spreading the word 👍"
Y’all need to start releasing he full unedited version
Listening to the unedited version is making me rethink my opinion of you. Release the full version
Kymmze J Asian dude went to shake their hands
Su no feminisim isn’t for everyone
I love and live for this channel but choosing a incel as the face of men’s rights activists it’s a bad look and it makes the entire group of male activists look like a degenerate (I’m not a male rights activist I’m j sayin) I LOVE THE CHANNEL THO
"SLiM M I wish Jubilee would have interviewed you, maybe that would have saved this mess of a video!!"
Jubilee Y'all should do for interracial marriages vs not for interracial marriages
Mallee Boy that's because women were not allow because men thought the woman's place was at home miss me with that dummy mess👏🏼 I'm not arguing with dummies 😘
Hey Jubilee I have an idea for a middle ground video. Atheists vs Christians.
"I think you all have done a great job selecting people open to hearing the other side and changing their mind. In this case, I think you missed the mark. Only Zach seemed willing to listen. Also, using an extreme movement, especially incels, that have been tied to numerous mass shootings as representative of a group is giving voice to to something that can’t be given a platform to share those views."
"What's very noticeable to me is how contradictory the feminists in this conversation were- especially Alyesha. 
>She said at the beginning of the video that she laugh at the idea of men being denied human rights. And during the discussion she claimed to be confused about what men's rights was and what MRAs were complaining about. 
>Yet, as soon as she heard about men's rights, she did a complete 180 and said ""Oh. Well that's just the system hurting you."" She also claimed that toxic masculinity was hurting men. 
>Basically, like most feminists, she goes from claiming that everything is in favor of men and they don't need any help, to claiming that she's helping men fight against a system. 
This is what's wrong with feminism."
"Why did Jubilee media invite a non-MRA for the MRA side? He clearly stated that he wasn't apart of the movement and that he was apart of the incel movement. So, it made no sense for him to be there at all.That's biased and unprofessional on Jubilee's part."
"Are we going to ignore the fact that they brought an incel who does not even identify as an MRA into the MRA camp? Why would they screw the entire conversation by bringing in this person who does not even seem genuine with his constant smirking,  cynical laughter, insincere concessions and pointlessly inflammatory responses."
" @billys313  He's not an extremist. He's not a MRA at all. As he stated in the video, eh was apart of the incel movement. He doesn't even represent the men's rights movement. It made no sense for him to be there."
" @kaylao.3326  >I talk about black men all of the time. I'm also writing an article about black men being targeted by police officers. 
>Warren Farrell brings up black men in his speeches
>Allison Tieman talked about black men at the men's conference in Chicago ICMI 2019
>Hannah Wallen and Karen Straughan talks about the plight of black men. 
Have you ever talked to any MRAs? I doubt it. Talking about black men is not unheard of or rare in the movement."
"Jubilee you guys are a great channel but allowing these type of men to be on your channel and share there very flawed and incorrect arguments is damaging to society, the channel preaches that all are equal however letting people come on the channel and say otherwise is quite despicable, simply put the men in this video are not “good humans”"
"The point of all this women are not  accountable for anything.

Women are trying to tell men how to act??????????"
Be Feminine not a feminist
pro animal testing vs against it
 @DreamlandRoses  You have to cover all grounds of the argument as best as you can. Not saying I disagree though.
"I don't identify as a MRA, but I think there are valid men's issues that were brought up by this conversation that aren't truly addressed by the feminist movement. I think the feminists were willing to acknowledge some of these issues as being real, but like Kursat said; what feminist organization is actually legitimately trying to address these problems? I think as an ideology, feminism does generally want equality of the genders, but as an organization/movement it is almost entirely focused on the right's and issues of women which leaves no real outlet for men to discuss and work on the distinct issues they face in society.
Also, I found a lot of what Zach and Derrick were saying to be extremely cringey and regressive thinking. They acknowledge genders as being different on a biological level which is obviously true, but then also want to chain everyone's identity and forms of self-expression to traditional notions of gender which are subject to cultural relativism. Essentially, the ""it is this way, therefore it ought to be this way"" fallacy. I feel like Kursat was pretty intelligent/thoughtful though and wasn't coming from a traditionalist perspective and just wanted to deal with the contemporary issues some men face that aren't taken seriously in the mainstream. Idk, it just felt like the people chosen could have been more balanced. As others have said, there could have been a female MRA and a male feminist present. And the incel derrick derailed the conversation so frequently that no legitimate conversation of men's issues or feminist issues could really be fleshed out."
beth wtf? WhT you talking about .... in the USA which women are not allowed to vote ?
The questions were so biased from the get go. Ridiculous
"I want that Derrick guy to explain what makes HIM superior to anyone, man or woman."
" @David-Borromeo  Damn dude, respect for even taking a crack at this. I gotta say this was a really disappointing display from Jubilee, I knew their biases but I really had hoped they would try to be good. If you didnt already would you mind telling more about your PHD being terminated, I would be interested to hear the story they cut."
Guys i really respect y'all and what y'all do but please don't invite an incel on this again he does not rep mens rights he reps for an actual patriarchy and subjugation of woman.
I’m no good person
 @D0NCH33T0  and toxic women are also real ...  pointing out some rare examples  like it supposed to mean anything ? We are all equal bad and good .
 @tinyguy1015  NO . And the wage gap is not real in the sense how feminists use  it .
 @olderbadboy  true
Jubilee yo it drives me crazy when they ask what does a feminist man look like because as a male feminist I feel like I can make my points and debunk a lot of their arguments. I would love to talk with a group of men like this so they can hear feminism from a man’s voice which is more difficult for them to be dismissive of. This episode was great and I really feel for the woman that had to open up and I’m proud of her for not spiraling and staying strong ✊🏽
 @David-Borromeo  i subscribe to you now
 @user-nv3sh5jh3p  exactly what i waa gonna ask.
"EVERYBODY: Kursat is amazingly intelligent and extremely well researched; he's the only ""real deal"" MRA on the panel. I have a live-stream with him on my channel and he really goes into his story there, so check it out if you want to know why this guy is world-famous for his activism!

Also, although I have no disdain for Zach; I just don't think of him as an actual ""men's rights advocate"" (maybe ""student"", because he seems a bit new). I can name about 7 people in one breath that would have been better for the panel... strange happening."
Agent piggles One woman being disrespectful doesn’t represent the entirety of feminism
" @PrinceofQueens  They intentionally didn't invite any of the usual MRAs, because they usually come off as reasonable, well researched, and rational. They invited Derrick-who's not a MRA and Zach-who seems fairly new to the movement and ideas. This was intentionally set up to give feminists the advantage and make them look like the correct side."
" @x-man9473  yeah, at first I was like ""is it just me or....?"", and then I saw K's comments and I realized the feminist propaganda machine strikes again."
" @x-man9473  yeah, MRAs talk about racial minorities a LOT, when it comes to their issues as men (false allegations, disposability etc are so huge). We're very diverse people; I'm an openly gay MRA, and I work with several similar."
Never make another episode of this these women are so anoying
"You want MEANINGFUL and PRODUCTIVE dialogue like THIS right jubilee?

@AffinityMusikProduction youre still coming off as hysterical. I'll trt again:



Forcing women to carry to term against their will is forcing them to be mothers.



Adoption is an alternative to parenting, it's not an alternative to pregnancy. 





Abortion is taking responsibility.

WHAT A JOKE"
don’t bring derrick back
"Min Suga's Natural Hair Is Daebak  Yeah equity is also a neuro surgeon being paid the same amount as a post man, in theory it may seem nice but in practice it will never work"
 @acemanEpic  Nicely said!
Jubilee I appreciate that you had a dialect but it seemed like each side wasn’t fair I wish it would have been both men and women on both sides. And the feminist were aggressive from the start like wtf was that about
Roses So true
I loved the camera quality of this video! What camera you guys using?
" Miles Hamblen  because men shouldn't think anything negative about women
And women never say anything disparaging about men"
" @superskullmaster  it

Those guys were useless..... only the Asian guy had any sense.
" @user-nv3sh5jh3p  I  consider  myself MGTOW but for me MGTOW is about forging your own path in life and bettering yourself. Most of us  had bad experiences with bias against men, it might be the  family  court or the workplace fatalities or the homelessness dominance or even in relationships.  But MGTOW is also a broad spectrum of mens with varying ideas. Some don't want anything to do with  marriage, some don't want to work  with women  because of fear of  false accusations, some are just looking for a place  to talk to other men with varying  experiences. MGTOW isn't about correcting those bias, we acknowledge them and continue living our lives and trying to be the best we can be. Men's right is about fixing these bias. By the way everyone can say that the guy who assaulted someone and hurt that individual is an asshole  but i feel that feminism is saying that it's because of the way boys are educated and  that's just not  true. Most boys become men and never assault or hurt anyone, they just live their  lives. Instead  of  trying  to fix it systemically by education, fix it locally where  the problem arise. This world is bound to have bad  mens  aswell as bad women, doesn't  mean that every man is bad or that every women is bad."
I really hope this does not get buried in the comments but please call me have me on here for a part 2 to this I do believe I would be a great advocate on representing why Mens rights are so important as well as communicating a little better to the opposing  Argument
" @David-Borromeo  I am really sorry to hear what happened with you : < But just because of one person's action we can not predict the actions of a community moreover I believe that there are times things are happening very wrong with us but we must frame our beliefs not solely based on present but based on past, present and keeping future in mind! I hope you do well in the future and can reach the authorities regarding your Ph.D."
"Eh, I get what your saying but from what I’ve seen a lot of MRA threads online are pretty sympathetic to incels and the ideals of both of them overlap a lot of the times. The fact that neither of the other mras in the video called out any of the incel’s comments basically confirms that they don’t have a problem with him either, unless jubilee edited it out. But I don’t see why they would. I mean, isn’t the whole point of this series to find common ground? So if the mra’s disagree with each other surely they’d put that in."
Women want men pay and drive them around lol all one's I met are like that
" @ms.flowers1049

"Mia not necessarily, most are anti-feminism but there's this sect that have become totally anti-women which I personally think isn't right, I think women have been targeted because of the emotions they carry, making them most susceptible and easiest prey to emotional manipulation and hysteria, successfully taught that their protectors are actually actively oppressing them, there's a minority of men who are sick who prey on women, as well as there are women that are sick and capable of otricites who prey on men. Truth be told, men just want to love women and want women to love them, or at least they did, til the social engineering we call feminism really took off, MGTOW is just an unfortunate, but necessary byproduct"
I think it’s a set back for all black people when black women identify as feminists as apposed to black feminists.
16:15 have to love people who have no facts but knows for a fact😣. By the way one name is not a list.
I would like to see black feminists and white or at least women of color.
Jubilee you need a part 2 of this... cuz I have more questions then answers. So please make a part 2
"To honest, the guy in the middle made me nervous... none of the men actually opened up and only two of them were actually listening. I can’t really fully agree with either side, but I don’t like the idea of molding someone into something they are not... stop locker room talk?? Have they heard some of the stuff a lot of women say about men?? One thing I can agree is about the fear of what will happen based on the clothing you wear."
"The problem with the today's world is, we have too many ""Alyesha"" and ""Derrick"" emotion driven, blatant misogyny loud mouths causing tension between people. We need more people like Bea and Zach."
"I really liked the links to the research, is it new or do you do it in other videos?"
"The Baddest Witch On the Block Not every man has “ran the world”. Your comment is exactly the toxic femininity that TRUE mras are talking about, you ignore and shame issues that men deal with and claim that its to “belittle womens rights” when in reality they acknowledge that women deal with struggles but that men do too(ex. men shamed for sexualizing women when women do the same or women on average jailed for less time than men for the same crime). Im a socially awkward black man and im pretty sure i don’t have the same benefits of toxic masculinity than a extroverted white man or even a feminist white women."
MGTOW is just the unfortunate but much needed byproduct of feminism and the power imbalance women have over men in the courts
Jency Victor so the color of your skin is part of the problem? I'm a shy introverted white man I'd NEVER be able to have a rational conversation with a black woman feminist
U should have gotten dr shaym!!
"Watching this video made me l
25% more feminist"
" @David-Borromeo  She didn't laugh at men having rights. It was clear to me that her problem was with men feeling the need to advocate for men's rights, being that we live in a society dominated by males."
Anyone who States they'd want to go back in PAST probably isn't good for a conversation that's supposed to be PROGRESSIVE
Derrick is just the male rights erin
" @David-Borromeo  I really can relate to this I have been oppress by my late manager who was a woman at the time I was working in a labor job as a backroom worker on a conveyor belt with women to tear down box and stock inventory at the same time I was look at being the only Male in the room to be able to work harder because I was a male and to take word abuse more because i was a Male again, I couldn't work in the changing room of the retail store  because I was a Male,  I was told I shouldn't hang clothes up I should just lay them out and let the women hang them up because they can hang faster than me I wasnt even giving a chance to hang them."
I did not like this episode at all. I think the only two people who really seemed to be open to have a healthy dialogue the most were Zach and Bea.
"Hey 

Can you revisit this but with female MRAs and Male Feminists??"
The ladies were right about men being told to toughen up. I feel like a feminist. My mom is like a Men's Right's activist.
Jubilee can you do one with equalist vs. Incels?
We need LGBT Conservatives and LGBT Democrats one pleaseee
"Rica Zoë Mizhen women are equal to men 

Women have more rights then men do in multi areas"
demarcio hicks if you do more work you should ask for a higher pay or send them your 2 week notice.
Zach said you cut out a lot of Kursat's contributions. How come?
.
Rica Zoë Mizhen any word that is favored towards one sex isn’t for all.
 @David-Borromeo  they need to release this unedited
 @QuinGuitardotcom  kids getting spanked by their parent's make more sense than adults getting killed by uncle Sams tax enforcer's
" @pitpride1220  I don't consider Incels ""mine"""
"OsefKincaid I agree. When he was on the incel episode I thought I was gonna get some insight into him. Oh boy was I wrong. They should’ve stayed with the reviews from his episode and kept him from this. He’s not a men’s rights guy, he’s an incel ... they are not one and the same. They are mainly upset they can’t get someone and from there they have messed up views about women"
Invite dr. Shayne to this middlegrounds.
"I don't think the candidates you have for the men rightfully represent most men. Some points are agreeable but many of them are egregious and hard to listen to. The guy in the middle needs therapy, and the activist doesn't speak up enough knowing the profession position that he holds. The women made very good points."
Can y'all redo this episode with new candidates?
I’m annoyed that the women in this video had to sit there and explain why they should have rights. I cannot take anyone of these men seriously
"Jubilee !@ATTENTION@!

Hi, I was thinking that you could do an episode on 5 rich men and 1 poor man. A common phrase is “Don’t take financial advice from a poor man”.

It would be interesting to put this to the test and see if they can find which one out of them is the poor man. 

They wouldn’t talk about their pasts, but instead would give each other financial advice and they would have to vote a man out from there.

Thanks!!!"
"What middle ground is doing, is basically just the start of what needs to happen to bring both sides together. The different groups would need to meet more often and try to solve issues together and maybe research more about topics - also together. Most of the time people just throw their opinions onto each other."
"Dragon Fire 
The other two were a bit extreme too"
 @lucasr_s  Thank you. I agree that Derrek was an extreme. Not all incels or mras think/feel the same. Derrek should NOT be the representative for incels or mras.
"This basically turned out as I expected. Statistics vs emotions (and then there was Derrick). The one thing that I think is lost in this is a very key point of cultural upbringing. What we've seen over the last 100 years is a departure from the gender roles THAT WERE GOOD. A man that's raised to cherish and protect women doesn't cat call or harass them. But all these fatherless homes have led to men that don't know how to be men. So they let their hormones/emotions run wild. The toxic masculinity that the women gave examples of were all characteristics that an old fashioned man would detest as well. I'll bet that every last one of the male culprits that were given as examples of toxic masculinity didn't have a father, or had a father that wasn't much of a man himself. What we see now with the feminist movement is an over correction that doesn't address the real problem at hand. The reality is that most movements don't know when to end. The people in them often push beyond the point of actual equality because they're trying to ""even things out"" by giving the once minority side MORE than the once majority side as a means of compensation for the past. Unfortunately this just result in another imbalance and kickback that defeats the original purpose."
"This channel has the potential to be the most powerful platform on the internet for the future of the world. But it’s holding itself back with the absolutely horrendous screening process. I mean just get people who are thoughtful, can communicate well, and can listen to others points of view and maybe the middle ground episodes can have actual resolutions. Instead we get derricks."
"hey u know when Alyesha says that she was attacked for saying ""no"" - will Derrick said that the ways have been lost which interpret it to be that if the women don't go out wearing skinny clothing and half naked body and makeup then i'm pretty sure no one  will come up to them to talk about relationships and what not - and like Derrick also mentioned that it should go back to the old ways but not too back that a man can do anything to a women but where women look after the children as will as the man and where man provides rather than women or both. for example if the women stayed home and natured the children properly than there would be no rape, group grooming and knife crimes etc. which all have risen in the last couple of decade. All I am trying to say is that bring equality but don't change the ways(women and men can both do the house work together but man should still work and women should raise the children's with good morals and manners - I mean feminist say that we should be allowed to work to fulfil their desires but I MEAN WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO STAY HOME AND STILL GET EVERYTHING THEY WANT(no work))."
"SLiM M you are an intellectual and have a great unbiased opinion, love the pfp btw"
"@Layla Petes Do you think it has anything to do with the fact the black single mother rate is over 70%? Personally, I don't see anything in the black community improving until that one, single problem is addressed. Why do you think the rate is so high for African Americans compared to others? Please don't give me the, it's because of racism, answer either because I really don't think that's it. Before the Civil rights movement the single mother rate was about 10%. After it, the rate shot up to where it is today, around 70-80%. I don't think as a nation we are more racist than back then. So, I don't see that as having any correlation to the issue of single moms in the black community. I'd also go so far as to say that as a culture we're currently more racist toward Muslims and South Americans, and they aren't having even close to the same problems with single moms. 

To add, women initiate about 80% of all divorces. Would it be fair to say a lot of the issues the black community currently faces, can be linked to the disappearance of the family unit? If so, do you see black women as being a major driver of the decline in the family unit  for African Americans?"
Do you think you guys can quit leaning so far to the left it's kind of obvious in this video you could have picked better you could have ask better questions that sided with the men and Derrick wasn't even needed or wanted
Science fiction 26 how would it be sexist or racist?
" @francoblu9498  
Want to know something funny?  If you go and read some of the literature from prominent feminists, they literally say that they want to destroy the family unit in the West."
" @kaylao.3326  So you're discounting a whole movement because the two men you saw in this video (Derrick doesn't count) didn't specifically mention a single issue that definitely doesn't affect them personally? That's in addition to the fact that they were not given equal opportunity to speak (continually interrupted by the feminist speakers) and the two with any sense were barely allowed to finish a point. While somehow Derrick (a clear plant if I've seen one) was able to get through pretty much all of his ridiculous, troll rhetoric.

If you reply judging an entire moment based on a 25 minute video then you are doing nothing but proving their point, that women don't really care about men's issues and feminism isn't really any equality. Also you are doing the same thing feminist and women continue claim is done to them: You are dismissing an entire gender's struggle based upon only a couple of examples."
Jubilee guy in yellow literally has a video I’m an incel ask me anything. Why would you chose him to represent men. Everyone else was good picks
Franco Blu Men have been freed from that burden and women are pissed that men are adapting
This would have been a lot more interesting with someone like me who is a woman that is a recovered feminist and definitely a traditionalist. To find middle ground is to meet someone  who has found middle ground through understanding both spectrums
May I recommend a segment about 2 groups come together and solving problems?
"This topic is a very ""hot"" one, and when you choose people, you should apply a little more strict rules to reject unbalanced individuals like Derrick. The quality of their arguments is usually weak, and they unnecessarily complicate the already difficult discussion."
 @David-Borromeo  you did well to represent dude you had the facts and caught them out on there lies and manipulative tactics.
"You picked the worst men to bring on, I swear to god. Thanks for giving people more fuel to ignore the mental health and violent abuse issues that men face."
having an incel represent men's rights is disingenuous. were you intentionally trying to discredit the men's rights in doing so?
I don't think this is an accurate representation of mens rights activists
Look I'm black African man and I think you're a good example of a leftist driven platform to push their agendas.
"This video was terrible. The only person that came with any salient information was kurasat. It turned into a ""who has it worse"" competition. Two of the women were stating they believe that men's rights activists are dismissive of women's experiences while dismissing points raised by kurasat.  

And the dude in the yellow just derailed the whole thing. It was clear he wasn't there to have a discussion. I'd definitely redo such an important topic like this with other people. Mostly because it feels like what happened here misrepresents both sides"
" @leonalma7010  It's likely he was a plant imo, they used him to make MRA's look bad, while I don't 100% agree with everything they say, Kurasat made good points"
Good job for obscuring human rights
Dawg Jubilee you should have put me on this episode I would have put this whole debate to rest with 1 sentence hit me up sometime I wanna do one of these
Boss vs employee 😎😎
 @bethteklu3194  TIL women in the US aren't allowed to vote. k
Part 2 but without the piece of garbage
I don’t think adding an incel to the group was a good idea. That was absolutely unfair to the men’s rights movement.
How much did you pay dereck ?
Maybe you should get better Feminist representative because these three just made women in general look like cry-babies. Love the male advocates.
 @David-Borromeo  I respect your views Kursat. You were very fair and carefully chose your words. Hopefully you can get a seat with jubilee again along with some better teammates or maybe on a different channel. Thanks for taking your time to represent men Kursat.
 @samwight  all three women were hostile as fuck as soon as they were challenged. Watch the video again and watch how all three of them get emotional and start twisting words as soon as they are challenged.
Jubilee need to see more black representation
Jubilee at least a black man’s view (more black representation)
 @lklk5162  same goes for the feminists getting angry and Co frontational over simple questions
@Rica Zoë Mizhen no it isn't don't be silly
 @The_Knowledge_Seat  the women didn't make a single good point aprt from personal issues and shutting down the men in a confrontational manner.
 @kristas4495  that's not how this was and you know it. The two men asked simple questions the women overreacted.
 @x-man9473  It makes perfect sense if you want to discredit a movement before anyone can see what it really is and form an opinion. This serves one purpose. So people can say they listened to an MRA and not search out real MRAs and what they stand for.
Take Mimi to Saudi Arabia and let her ramble off those talking points..
" @kaylao.3326  Firstly, feminism means something different to everyone, so it  doesn't have to be intersectional. Also the mens rights movement isn't an intersectional movement, which is why they aren't interested in Black Lives Matter. They are instead more focused on general issues that the majority of men are likely to face (suicide, homelessness, family courts, etc)."
"Why: no one who is both feminist + advocating for men's rights?
No male feminists?  No female advocates for men's rights?"
None of these people have any idea what they're talking about
 @sciencefiction2665  Nice bait.
" @predatorhunter3169  some black / brown people and some women will not forgive white men for there past. Personally, I don't live in the past, so I'm not bothered about joining movements to get a history lesson."
 @kension333  Couldn't have put it better myself. It's like moaning about government all the time... Still got to get / have a life. Although it's fun hearing debates
please do bring male feminists and female men's rights activists and put them together with the feminists and men's right activists it will be more interesting
Science fiction 26 well they need to get over it
"... to be honest, i'm not entirely sure if this show is as useless as it seems, because i'm watching Honey Badger Radio commentary on it, and they cut down even more from what you've cut down, and i'll need to watch this original of yours afterwards, but so far from what i've heard there, it seems pretty bad, and useless, and offtopic.

your first mistake being not actually having invited actual MRAs,except one. second mistake, cutting out almost everything that single one MRA had said. third mistake, having many offtopic questions. i don't know... as i said, i'll have to watch your actual cut, but so far it seems very misrepresentative and not a useful debate."
Luke Keister just stop while you’re ahead 🤦🏽‍♂️
Where's the talk on toxic femininity or is that guys just need to suck it up and be better?
" @bethteklu3194  
Where? In some foreign nation? How does that reflect on the specific nation(s) these people come from? 

Do men have all the rights? Really?

Well I can tell you that men don't have the same rights as women, certainly in the UK. Circumcision is perfectly legal, whilst any genital cutting of a girl is illegal (even the types of genital cutting that are less invasive than circumcision). Men also don't have the same protections under the law as women in respect to women.

In the US there's selective service. Which was always something men had to sign up to, but woken never.  If a man didn't sign up to it, he could have ended up in prison. He certainly wouldn't get a driver's license or certain forms of government assistance."
 @brooke.t.g.r5646  they deleted his comments
"Raverto the men were the only one who hade facts
While the girls only spoke on how there personal live were which doesn’t help represent for all woman"
Don Cheeto how do you define toxic masculinity?
"beth we need more context for what you’re saying because it does not make sense since we live in America were everybody has the right to vote.
 like Is this happening in America or a different country."
OsefKincaid you know I don’t see too many people making videos about this unless they’re men. And although these girls do not have fax to stand for their argument they still came up here anyway and presented their thoughts
Annabelle But the topic was not about their personal lives it was him representing for men not for just himself
Annabelle and for what I was herring the women say they only represented themselves that’s why it’s hard for them to counter any of the three the men. Because they did not have the factual points for women
Fred Starner never
John Cooper - Art of Social If you can’t handle the title don’t click on the video
HatsOnJohn did any of the three men in this video actually say they’ve never had a girlfriend or that they don’t actually date like at all. Because if I’m being honest with you Throughout the whole entire video nobody wants mentioned anything about dating
Luke Keister OK then so on the girl side besides talking about their personal lives. what did they say that you agreed with
acemanEpic Did you actually look at the video or did you skim through it
acemanEpic The whole point of the video was that the man was post to speak on the behalf of the men in the girl supposed to speak on the behalf of the girls that does not mean they have to agree it just means they have to come to an understanding.
Zach Bunch I don’t think the black Community were the only ethical group that mattered in the subject of men and women
Su can you tell me anything the feminist are trying to do for men? And it’s funny you say this and in the video the guy asked the girl a specific question (what are feminists trying to do for men) she gives no comment because there are none there’s no feminist group who’s helping men
Sam Wight If you watch the video and paid attention to both sides you would’ve noticed that the girls didn’t actually know how to respond to what the three men were saying Instead what they did was interrupted them when they were in the middle of talking and brought up non-factual points
Sam Wight in which those non-factual points were brought to light in the females did not know how to respond to it look at the video just saying
Kayla O. With the talking about in this video is not just about black man or black females it’s about all men of races in or female of races
"Jubilee I’m sorry but this is honestly one of the worst episodes you’ve created. A lot of important points were cut from both sides and bringing Derrick was like bringing a supremacist to an equal rights discussion. He wasn’t articulate, he wasn’t helpful and he held back the discussion for both sides. 

Men’s rights activist is already going to form negative views from the name alone. By adding Derrick you made it drastically harder for those who viewed the men negatively to change opinion. The whole point of this is to see the argument from both sides despite our biases, but adding Derrick was almost confirming/personifying those biases and playing into them."
"It's was decent to good,if we can do a race /class esipode"
Release the full cut. Kursat was censored.
" @taunoctua245  indeed,when he and Zach were making the points in the basket and Derrick was the distraction...

Next time same formula - Derrick"
 @kaylao.3326  he just stole the show
" @hexa1905  maybe a bit ,but snowflake 🚨"
I heard the full audio from one of the guest and it shows your true colors you eddited this to make the men look as bad as you could
Can you do black lives matter and all lives matter!
I would love to be on one of these..........I want to have an intellectual dialogue
Did not pick all the right ppl 😒
"3:51 Goddamn it, Derek."
"Can we have a part two, just without Derick"
You edited the major parts of it to make one group look bad. You were an inspiring channel. I looked up to you. It’s unusual how the new light falls into the same old agenda darkness.
do minimalists vs maximalists
" @David-Borromeo  She didn't laugh at the idea of men having rights, she laughed at the notion of men needing to advocate for rights when, to her, it appears men have more advantages than women. You can say she's wrong for having that perspective, but there's a difference between not understanding why someone would believe they're being treated unfairly, and thinking that person should be treated unfairly. Your comment implies she felt the latter, which isn't the case. She even asked you all to share what pain you've experienced."
"Bruh I fight (hyper) feminism all day every day and 2 out of 3 of these men made me want to just go and support feminism.
I feel like that's exactly what you wanted to achieve, growing support for feminism by making MRA look like assholes, while most MRA men just want true gender equality on both sides of the spectrum.
Most MRA men I know are like the feminists in this video, but just disagreeing with feminism being called feminism and being too focused on women issues."
"The incel was not an mra ... not once did he say anything about being an mra or try to defend mens rights ... he was a traditionalist which has nout to do with mens rights
Incel are not mens rights activist (want to be with women but cant)
Migtow are not mens rights activist (dont want to be with women or held to there standard)
Pick up artist are not mens rights activist ( want to be with women but hold little value to women)
They all have there own problems and solutions that maybe cover by mras but that does not make them mra
Mens rights activist ( fights for the social political and economic rights for men and boys like how WRA (not femist) do for girls and women)"
" @kymmzej9173  If someone told me to my face that they think I'm less than them because of my gender (that women are like lost children??) and didn't listen to my point of view at all, I don't think I owe them a hug"
"When one of the women states that she has shared her personal experiences but has not heard any of the men share theirs, not only does no one actually come up with a personal experience but one of the men says that he would never invalidate her experiences but it's dangerous to give emotional testimony that may not be what it is. Um, isn't that what invalidating is?"
Short Answer- NO.
Jubilee please don’t have Derrick back on the show🙏
"Okay, so after having watched your video, and having watched stream of Honey Badger Radio where they talked with one of the participants, and after skimming through his recording, all that I can say is: RELEASE THE FULL VIDEO, YOU BIASED LIARS."
Don Cheeto So true
Keyur Dwivedi We don’t need a woman going over saying men needs more rights.
Mia what does that stand for?
Should have had incels on both sides
"Please be open to the idea of going back to this topic after hearing suggestions in the comments. Having a female MRA and male Feminist, questions that spark real conversation and aren’t just hashtag/buzzfeed/clickbait lines, not having people cut each other off whilst making points, etc."
Next time add a male feminist and female mens rights activist. Cant believe you guys dropped the ball there
 @user-nv3sh5jh3p  why talk about it
 @LukeK813  stay in your bubble good for you
 @yourarchnemesis8453  women vote
 @kaylao.3326  as a black man myself i hate how black are always gonna be judges unfairly because of women like you is so sadd
 @TheDarkOne9942  sargon or peterson they are not mras
@Layla Petes what lie are u gonna invent now about kursat
 @MaxLeGrand33  don't be hostile plss
 @David-Borromeo  what bill trump signed
" @user-nv3sh5jh3p  MRA and MGTOW are exclusive. The later is a social choice to avoid roles of marriage or  what some would consider traps. I could be because they don't want to get a divorce or spend energy on people who will end up draining them of resources. An MRA, is someone trying to address real world bias in issues for makes."
"are you proud of this? cause i sure wouldn't be. there are so many wrong things said in this. for example 9:23. ""more equality"". yep, that's exactly what feminists really want. more. not of the equality but of the benefits. or that other time the same person got triggered and justified her lack of knowledge with ""your little research and whatever"". let's not even talk about the child-man that calls himself an incel. i think that most of the things these women say in regards to the men's right movements are just wrong and spiteful and actually it's a self reflection of what feminism is in reality."
👏 WAGE 👏 GAP 👏 IS 👏 NOT 👏 REAL 👏
 @amorestierraamadahermoso5810  🤣🤣 I'm glad you find me funny! Where did I bash white men? I'm a white man.
" @333baphomet  I aggree that they stuck to their predetermined opinion about the MR movement. However , I don't think its entirelly their fault. Jubilee did not represent the community sufficiently with the individuals they invited, and the questions that were asked did not allow them to explain what the movement is actually about, referring to my earlier answer. The feminists in the video seem sensible enough. You sorta have to expect a bit of SJW-activism from people who say yes to representing a movement that has tilted in a very sjw direction. I aggree that she overreacted upon the question she was asked, however the question did warrant a response of some kind."
You should do about hinduism vs other religions.
"1) Imagine that tomorrow the government made it legal for men to rape women. 
2) I would be horrified and I think everyone would be
3) I think it is disgusting to have 1/2 of the population legally be allowed to be raped by the other half. Agreed?
4) Imagine at this time that there was no women's movement.
5) Imagine the media did not share this information and the public did not know.
6) When a woman came and said we need to change this horrific law and start a women's movement, wouldn't you agree?
7) Do you think it would be fair to keep that horrific law or to ask women why there should be a woman's movement?
8) Did you know that in most of the world, including most of the western world it is not against the law for women to rape men?
9) I think it is disgusting to have 1/2 of the population legally be allowed to be raped by the other half. Do you still agree?
10) The men's movement is very small.
11) The media does not cover this.
12) When a man comes and says we need to change this horrific law and start a men's movement, wouldn't you agree?
13) Do you think it would be fair to keep this horrific law or to ask men why there should be a men's movement?"
"Love your channel. Disappointed in the missed opportunity to have a woman represent male rights activist as well as a man for woman's rights activists. Not sure how I feel about the word feminist yet , but I do hope you can remake this! I think it could be so much more moving if you did."
Can you guys do a second video with better prepared speakers. This discussion lacked a good representation of individuals who can fully articulate their thoughts.  The ph.d student and two of the girls expressed themselves well. Would like to see a second video with a different set of people.
"No one said ""women are misguided"", they said ""feminists are misguided"", which would mean she is unable to understand, btw noone of us have rights, we have privileges and benefits as long as we agree to operate with a birth certificate, men and women have the same privileges and benefits, these two groups are very small picture people, grow up."
"The british guy really did his research , I'm sad he didn't face off with the angry black woman but still worthy to watch"
"So the conversations of men are only good if they are like the conversations women have?
I grew up in a house full of women and trust me the conversations women have about men can be horrible. Women are just as toxic as men."
Don Cheeto x Skullcandy x Mary Kay type beat
"The feminist on here say they aren't children, but want to be treated like Children, basically protect me, let me do what I want. Men and Women are built differently and one of the roles of a Male throughout nature is to protect his family. It's really a case of performing different roles. Feminists who believe they can be an active  mother and work full time dont make logical sense, you simply cant. You have to choose, feminists who minimise the role of a mother verses tapping a keyboard ? Men and Women are a partnership, we aren't equal in ability or strength, or emotion, no one is. Its absurd to say we all are equal. We can treat each other with equal respect but to believe all humans are equal at ability and strength is just nonsense. If people are lead by principles as is the case in Christianity  , as the guy rightly said you dont treat a child well because they have equal strength or aptitude, you treat them well, because you understand you need to treat all people well, and protect the vulnerable."
Do anti vaxxers vs silence
I mean sience
"Was wondering if you had an uncut redetion, just like to hear the small talk"
@beth Not in the US or any other country democratic nation.
@Fred Starner Maybe Gamers vs anti-gaming.
"@Layla Petes A flawed opinion from what I understand of what an incel is they’re people who hate the gender female. I’m a feminist for equality but as a men’s right activist on several issues. I believe that women deserve equality but today’s modern feminism is a shame. The whole he said she said court rape cases is wrong as that’s destructive. The unbiased drivers’ insurances why should it cost me a higher cost of my gender when more women are at a risk of getting into car accidents. Mansplaining okay why is that something wrong or why is manspreading wrong? The target of the smallest thing is arbitrary. Toxic masculinity is very broad it’s a like being masculinity is toxic that me being a guy is toxic because I have masculine traits. Traits of me being a musician, or being physically active it’s a choices I pick because I choose that. Also if I’m offering someone who I asked out I would pay my girlfriend offers to pay for my meal when she asks me out for dinner. I just don’t believe that women should use money as a factor when looking for a man to date money isn’t a trait it’s just income which is wrong to me."
"Stop being shitty journalists. You know full well that this wasn't originally even about MRAs, that two of the guys are not MRAs, and threw this together as low quality click bait. Do better."
Just be equal like dang females and males have done thier part for 200.000+years once yall got intelligent you just stoped. To be honest i dont really get it. We need both genders to continue this race i dont see why you people just like saying men are that men are those no not all men are like that but in reaility thats kinda how your here today without men how could we continue spreading our race?.
"Hi!
I hope there is a video in the works including the deaf. 
Such as “do all deaf people think the same” or “deaf vs. hearing”"
" @OsefKincaid  Ah yes, the old 'exposure to ideas is like a mind virus' old fashioned puritanism. Did you read the comments?"
 @irisdogma8174  Do you have a point to go with this?
" @OsefKincaid  IDK what specifically you are replying to, as I believe I made two comments under this thread, but assuming it was the first one; Other than that they misrepresented two of the three 'MRAs' as MRAs and created this as empty clickbait journalism, that no one should take seriously, and they should be ashamed of themselves, no. That was my only point."
"As a woman, they women's approach is annoying that I cant continue they video. Peace good people"
I very much enjoy your videos😊 Great channel! Keep it up!😆😊
"Both men and women have issues and neither gender is above or better than the other, each has their strengths and weaknesses, neither side should sit there and point fingers at the other, only way for balance and equality is for men and women to work together decently.."
" @irisdogma8174  Sure Iris. You said:
""Ah yes, the old 'exposure to ideas is like a mind virus' old fashioned puritanism. Did you read the comments?""


So I answered, in reference to this:
""Do you have a point to go with this?""


I was expecting you to understand what the conversation was about since you were the one to engage in it, but apparently that was too difficult for your large brain :/"
There isn’t representation for opposite genders on either side 😑

"Layla Petes If you’re black and saying this then golly. The self hatred. If you’re not, then sit down. The constant racial profiling, stereotyping of black men, and violence against black men is crazy. It’s not just black men. Although toxic masculinity is portrayed through male black rappers, there are so many men of other races who talk just like them. They support their music and believe in their ideologies. And the amount of non black men who rap about the same things- oh gosh! They’re just not popular creators. Don’t try to pin this on black men when it’s men of ALL races that contribute to toxic masculinity. Don’t pin your problems on black men and the black community."
 @Overused_Toothbrush  neither did Mimi
Male here. Zach's haircut is toxic to both genders'
 @superskullmaster  and having nothing but educated women... instead of a diverse range of educated women aka one who is a drop out one who is mid range and one who is top tier would of been fair... anyway... the fight is over in one statement... suicide... men commit suicide more than women do... aka more men are losing their lives than women... on top of that... society constantly tells men they are expendable...draft anyone? the draft basically says men lives are less important than women's.... until women are expected to lay down their lives for all... and are forced to like men are they will never be equal and always be more privileged than men.
"Seriously, who thought the incel was a good representative of men's rights. The other two were spot on, but the incel made them look terrible just by association. Do better."
I both feel bad for Derrick (he's basically all on his own here) but also cringe at it cause he's definitely a hardcore traditionalist.
" @D0NCH33T0  in general I disagree with the idea of toxic masculinity. There are toxic males yes see derick. There are toxic females. Unfortunately derick is Male however I don't think he is masculin. 

But that has to do more with how I view masculinity rather than the premise your making"
Agent piggles I hope you know that not all females are like that right?
Agent piggles nothing like laughing and calling people who raise awareness about male issues such as higher suicide rates is aggressive. and they call the mras toxic lol
Ok y'all got the wrong men for this. None of these kids have even lived life. I got cancer older than these boys
That sucked big time. Left my other lengthy comment below
See my playlist
beth yeah that was dealt with what 60 or 70 years ago.
 Miles Hamblen  lol
"I can’t be on either side. To me it seems both are a little prejudice in their beliefs. And while they serve good points, there’s still much more on that topic. And what’s more- equality. What is equality. We’ve invented this word but I still don’t truly know wat it means. We all have our own definition of equality, because we live our lives in our body, our point of view. So what’s right and what’s wrong depends on who’s looking at the situation and at what angle. Which makes me really wonder and think ‘we can’t ever achieve equality, so why are we trying so hard to make it happen.’ Sometimes I hear people say that it’s better if these kinds of things  didn’t happen. We wish to live in a world where equality runs free and we all love each other. But if I’m being honest I can’t imagine a world without racism, sexism, murderers, pedophiles, perverts, and so on. It would feel unnatural to me if these people weren’t part of this world. Is that right or wrong? It it offensive that I think this?"
Can you please just redo this to give men a chance.. Please?
 @bethteklu3194  oh actually I think it was over 100 years ago
16:25 she knew she fucked up when he hit her with the facts😭😭😭😭😭😭
Repeat it with a female man's right activist and a male feminist
There is a lack of maturity from both groups.
 @superskullmaster  all due respect but the black community was not the one in question.
 @DreamlandRoses  what's good for the goose is good for the gander ...its called equality.
 @agentpiggles6685  couldn't agree with you more.
500
Why can’t people just except that we are different but woman should respect and be happy with how much they’ve earned and then just be happy
Ban derrick.
"Hey Jubilee, there's so much bullying going on in the comments here of that Derrek guy. I don't agree with him at all, but it's so toxic seeing what people are saying on here. You should take responsibility and delete comments that are harmful and abusive."
I think we need a part 2 of this topic
"@jubille

Derrek was clearly a troll. the fact that you even brought him into this conversation ruined it. this could have been a great intellectual debate between men and women. we didnt have to involve children."
" @bethteklu3194  Wait, are we talking about western society? or globally? Cuz the conversation is about Western."
" @kymmzej9173  There was only 1 incel here, even though this is just supposed to be about men's rights."
 @LukeK813  Kursact was good
" @acemanEpic  Kursact was really good tho! Two were ok, but the other three were really bad! Especially Dereck! JESUS!"
You should of gotten a male feminist
Yes thay do especially when u or they play them for hours on and get outside and get in touch with nature or god
Why is that?
Why u say that? do u just have a lot of hate n ur heart and it's hard for u to Express how u truly feel?
Bruh.
"Those three guys representing men's rights was migraine inducing. 
As a guy, I see no need for it. A place to help men for anything. Sure, of course. But, rights? That should be a combination of men and women together coming to a solution. As women want to work to solve problems.

Men groups sadly gather men similar to those boys as help. So, the outcome is more accusatory against women groups."
"Yeah, Jubilee...
So many of your episodes are great. But you could have done a little more here.
Let's hear from a man that is a feminist?
A woman that is a men's rights advocate?
Some trans representation?
Normally yall are on point."
You should not have let those men get away with that misinformation like saying that women's oppression isn't real? It's giving a voice to the uneducated which is so harmful we're fighting hard enough to be heard we as women don't need to listen to this shite
Bro ITS not no one said better just stating statistics that’s not toxic femininity is a fact also you can’t claim me cause you not part of the group BUF
Fard
 @agentpiggles6685  fax
This episode was cringey. The incel fidgeting in his chair the ENTIRE EPISODE screams insecurity.
​ @bethteklu3194 that doesn't exist here in the US dude. Or dudette. That stuff happens in other countries and you know it does. And yes it's a problem over there. But that doesn't happen here
 @bethteklu3194 you’d be wrong but ok.
Derrick is a pathological narcissist.

"Men can’t be feminists, sweetie"
Ari Mijangos Ruiz I’m a man who considers myself a feminist lol
Jacob Steinberg so you hate yourself?
Ari Mijangos Ruiz literally not true. Feminism means the belief that men and women are equal. The large majority of men believe that too. Men can and should be feminists.
Jeana Geertgens they hav another video similar to this one where they do!
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz man here who is a feminist, yes we can be feminists it just means we believe men and women should be equal and that equality still has a little bit to go even if we’re much much better now than we used to be"
Ari Mijangos Ruiz men can be feminists lmao
"@A Little Slighty Artsy, AlexMatthew ... Wrong feminism has nothing to do with equality..."
I was kinda sad they didn't. They could've easily replaced Derrick
 @jacobsteinberg7702  Could you tell me one good thing that feminism says about men? Just one.
" @mijangos.4818  men can't be... But they can have a great understanding and education on feminism.
And learn how to suppress toxic behavior."
Ari Mijangos Ruiz I’m a male feminist lmao but ok
" @mijangos.4818  jeez you couldn't be more wrong. Men aren't these condescending, narcissistic people that always want to have power over women. Most men are feminists and smart and decent people. That's just facts sweetie"
a man whos a feminist would of been great!
 @roknroller6052  in the beginning it was but the feminists today changed it to the mess it is now which is why I am a female but I'm not a feminist.
 @elliedove7899  it was to show the difference between the types of men's rights
YES. @jubilee
"@the wolf pack elders... Yeah to be fair most women in the real world don't form their life perspective from feminist theory and kids on Twitter, Haha. Luckily for me, The ladies I meet aren't like those women...."
The conversation would go like “I think you should have rights” “I think you should have rights to”
Ari Mijangos Ruiz this is why theres people like derrick. Stop isolating. Men can advocate for women’s rights too. Men CAN be feminists. Why would you not want allies and more people in the movement?
"Agreed, they need devil's advocates with a different point of view."
"That’s just the thing. Men don’t agree with feminism at this point. Like myself. I believe that the older beliefs in feminism was right, like the right to vote and be independent and being equal, but feminism now goes beyond that trying to be better than men."
Jacob Steinberg it depends on who you go to a lot of feminist nowadays are far left
Ari Mijangos Ruiz literally what made you think that
 @epiphany_s  'feminists' who believe they are superior to men are misandrists.. we have to have more ppl know this.. we have to cleanse feminism of the misandry metastasizing in it..
 @mijangos.4818  That's not true
 @Bengiamino  Feminists don't/shouldn't hate men. It's not a movement of hate. The definition of feminism is the advocacy of women's rights on the basis that all sexes should be equal
"and black women that doesnt ask for pity with ""as a woman of colour"" nobody cares… (which is equality but also not caring that you hate your own race and gender)"
Yes! But I believe it would be much harder finding a men's rights woman than a feminist man
" @jacobsteinberg7702  no, they just blame everything even remotely horrible that happens in society on men."
 @sofam9645  interesting. So I missed the various feminist articles about how women should be drafted along with men and how female predators should receive the same jail time as male predators then. And equal custody rights - very prevalent in the feminist movement I gather. And I definitely remember all the lobbying from feminists to build and sponsor men's shelters.
" @alexmatthew3863  it was never about that. From the very beginning, women got the same rights as men without any of the obligations and responsibilities. It took years of case law to get men not to be held responsible for women's debts after women were earning their own income that they could easy live alone off of. 

Even if you disregard the unequal responsibilities, women were equal to men both in rights and status by the 90's as far as voting, land ownership, college degrees anyway. As far as domestic violence and rape laws - they have always helped only women. I don't see any feminists changing the law to arrest more female rapists or female abusers and, in fact, thanks to feminism male victims are more likely to be arrested than their rapists or abusers."
"I personally agree with the feminists, I feel as tho the men’s rights are just a thing to despite and go against feminism, if men’s rights focused more on legitimate issues like, toxic masculinity, Men’s mental health and stigma, suicide which had tripled in men the last decade which would kind of be linked with mental health, if we focused on issues such as that I don’t think it would be more beneficial instead of constantly attacking feminism, even better if we worked together to help fight these stigmas from both sides would be more beneficial."
 @mijangos.4818  the first feminists were men. Learn little bit about your own ideology before talking.
"@QUEENWARD XxXxXx... The pay gap has already been debunked many times over, For the same exact job same hours same experience and stats etc There's no gap. Then on TV, Radio etc personality and charisma comes into it, to complicate matters..

Feminism is not important when the main attack is on the Western world and the white man, Focusing on the societies that makeup the 10% of humans that are already relatively free compared to all of human history is ignorant!!!

Then to conveniently wash your hands of the rest of the world and on top of that actively promote multiculturalism and defend those very cultures that dehumanize women.. Just shows feminism for the joke that it really is!

And the people in the west that are supposedly oppressed from your marxist perspective are still better off compared to anywhere in the world or anytime in history. Any child can fabricate an idealism of a utopian paradise, but it's not real unless it has existed somewhere, Adults should know this...

People need to get some perspective and be grateful for what we have (for the time being) fully functional societies...."
 @thesoliloquist1940  feminism has already been hijacked.
" @Ignasimp   it hasnt, melodramatic person..😑 If you can cite the same examples pekgoz did, organizations generally are just a bunch of loud self important ppl who have the money and strings to pull to create a noticable impact vaguely based on the movement's tenets.. it isnt the ideology itself nor accurate representation of it..

Your argument is exactly as though you would argue that islam has 'already been hijacked' by terrorists.."
" @stevenchilds861  tbf we've mostly seen feminism attack mra.. 'feminists' (misandrists) are threatened by them congregating around mens struggles at all.. 

You never see mra crashing a feminist rally.. but you see plenty of that vice versa..

Instead of view them as a 'counter' movement to feminism, how about looking at it as though feminism inspired men to create change for themselves? Feminism's enemy has always been the patriarchy, not men.. certainly not the guy trying to get fair costody of his kids from a mother using them as collateral in a court system which will always award children, alimony and child support to women.. i know these men overcoming discrimination against them is only percieved as wanting their entitlement to things back only bc coincidently these men are the same gender as those higher in the societal hierarchy, but this isnt the reality.. these men who suffer discrimination dont deserve to be grouped in with the toxic men who perpetrate most of the sexism or racism just to keep things simple.. the majority of men who do face prejudice are also ppl..  

Higher caste men (most of the higher caste are men) are using lower caste men as concealment from blame, scapegoats and if lower caste men did do anything to help themselves, bc it was for 'men', then higher caste members could benefit too..this is ensuing just like a cultural war..  classism are the true divides..

Or the conspiracy isnt that dark and we are the idiots who are grasping at straws.."
" @thesoliloquist1940  it definitely has. Most feminists I know are quite radical. And feminism is everywhere. In my country all the news are about women who have died, women that have written books, or poems, women who have done whatever. Then I go to work to the highschool I work once a week we have to talk to our students about a woman that has done something important. And we (the teachers) have been forced to do a course of ""coeducation"" which was actually gender identity propaganda full of scientific inacuracies and lies. 

I'm gay and I'm already tired about it. The high school I work at is what we call a ""maximum complexity"" high school. All studentd are either gypsies, Muslims and latins, we have a lot of kids with really important psicological and developmental issues, and instead of making us do a course on how to deal with complicated situations all we learn is about is women, gays, and trans people. And don't get me wrong, a lot of woman, gays and trans people suffer a lot because of discrimination (gays and trans faaaaar more than women, though women are at the center of everything for some reason)  but it is definitely not the main issue we have to face. Our students have to face far more discrimination for being immigrants and poor than for being women."
" @Ignasimp  to reiterate, feminism isnt misandry.. 

Second, where do you live? 

I am for mens rights (gays rights) and i am a feminist.. i believe we have to be more forthcoming about the fact that feminism is for discrimination against women.. and not against 'all' discrimination.. i believe this could help make these 'radicals' chill.. these radicals, continue on believing they are against all discrimination while definitely only caring about how discrimination orients around women..  it is a confusing mess.. i think simplifying it down to what it is.. which is a movement by and for women will help straighten things out.."
 @thesoliloquist1940  I live near Barcelona.
"Normal feminism is the idea of bringing women up to be equal with men, not pushing men down. Women who hate men as a whole  aren’t feminists. They just hate men."
" @dahliamcgarvey5417  thats what it was meant to be in theory.. but this isnt what we are actually observing.. 

Feminism is for womens rights.."
" @mijangos.4818  yeah they can...Let's talk about racism. Let's say a Caucasian person wanted to speak up on racism involving people of color, or Hispanics, etc. Let's say that that person has never experienced first hand racism, yet they still speak up on it.  It's important that we get everybody to speak up about a problem, because that's what stops it. It's important that we get both sides to say that something is unfair, and cruel. Sure, gender is not the same thing as race, but you get the idea."
Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes we can
I would love to stand up for mens rights.
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz as a woman, that is entirely untrue, feminism is defined as the advocacy of women’s rights on the basis of equality of the sexes

there are plenty of men who support women in any way they can, it is incredibly closed minded to say that men can’t be feminists and sexist in itself. sexism against both sexes is real sweetheart—if a man said that women couldn’t be men’s rights activists you would call it sexism immediately.

hating men does not make you a feminist. empowering women does not mean hurting men. men are people, women are people. we experience emotions as PEOPLE."
I am a female who leans towards men's rights based on my experiences with men and i would have loved to see a female and male on each side too! We'd learn so much more than just the men on the men's side or the females on the feminist side!
Ari Mijangos Ruiz LMAO WHAT
 @mijangos.4818  This kind of thinking is part of the problem. Sweetie.
Jacob Steinberg 😂😂 you called him a toad like bruhh idk why that’s just so funny to me
I would have been ok with it if they had found alpha males and not weak males who folded everytime the guilt card was played.
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz men can be feminists. Feminism is defined as the equality between the genders, woman and men can advocate for equality between the genders."
" @mijangos.4818  a feminist is someone who believes in gender equality, men can believe in gender equality too"
 @mijangos.4818  congratulations you're part of the problem 🤚
Ari Mijangos Ruiz what??? anyone can be a feminist
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes they actually can be,sweetie."
Men can’t be feminists. Feminisms doesn’t want equality. Equality is just a consequence for the main purpose of the movement.
 @mijangos.4818  and women cant be =
 @mijangos.4818  I feel like making it so only females are entitled to be feminists more or less negates what you are standing for. You cannot have a movement that wants equal rights to both genders without letting both genders be part of that movement.
Matt mcgory and Sydney Watson
"Or a guy and a girl that are neutral, that advocate human equality doesn't matter what gender you are"
"rtuyoization that is entirely false. Men have just enough rights. The point of feminism is not to bring men down, its to bring women up to the same level"
 @jacobsteinberg7702  please don't say toad... That's very triggering
"@Valeria Vargas maybe in Islam countries  they aren't ready. Like you said, they are married and sold to men. This was a issue worldwide at some point in the past. Feminism rose in the US because of the strong protagonists who encouraged more and more women and people and educated them to the rights that women should have and deserve. It grew to a point where they could find back because they were high in numbers and brave. However, in countries like Islam, first of all their gov is fucked up, second of all, iss the gov that makes laws and provides rights to their people. If they allow protests, have rights granted to all humans, then ofc we would find feminists. But they're not even at the point where they can give human rights, they ARE behind and I hope this changes soon but it will take time. You can't expect the US and Islamic Countries to have the same results when they have COMPLETELY different scenarios."
" @thesoliloquist1940  yes sadly, people aren't aware of this fully"
" @Vae1769  Woah, listen the men thing is a whole different topic. You shouldn't bring that in feminism, you're just assuming that I'm some misandrist by saying that. Ofc I agree men can show their emotions and should, but that's off topic. Also, in the same jobs in many places, men are given more opportunities to THIS day and are given a higher salary just because they're men and ""are smarter and have more capability than women"". I can name you a bunch of places that do that. OFC places like the US are much ahead and don't do this but many other countries haven't been able to eliminate it yet."
"Im a woman, and i am a mens rights activist, would love to be in this discussion"
"Hey, I am a guy and a feminist, and I can assure all of you that being a feminist isn’t about hating men, actually, it has absolutely nothing to to with hate. On the contrary, feminism is about eliminating hate between men and women, and giving each equal rights. So men can be feminists"
Jeana Geertgens right I’m a men’s rights activist and I’m a girl
 @mijangos.4818  completely wrong
@Valeria Vargas please do some research first. Your arguments are just consumptions you made yourself.
" @sofam9645  that's what you say when you ask any feminist but it's a disguise for their dislike for the patriarchy and all that crap. If they want people to be equal, then tell me what feminists have done for men's rights"
 @mijangos.4818  yes they can feminism means equal rights for all not women impowerment
I believe that women should be equal but I don’t believe in their views on how men are always the aggressors
 @jackcarroll22  They aren't saying that at all. I think us men often take stuff like this as a hit. It's them spreading awareness.
 @mijangos.4818  thats totally wrong
Ari Mijangos Ruiz men Can totally be feminists...
 @mijangos.4818  the is the thickest thing I've ever read 😂
 @Bengiamino  insulting somebody without knowing them wont change anything
Ari Mijangos Ruiz feminism isn’t just about women equality. It’s literally about the equality of women and men💀
" @520c  hmm that's what it's meant to be, but feminists now a days is definately more about having power and being better/more entitled than men"
I wonder if they tried but couldn't find anyone willing. That would be interesting to watch.
Just add one common person who doesn't go along with either sides
 @mijangos.4818  just visit india
"Well by definition a man cant be a feminist, but that doesnt mean that you cant sympatize with it, you become an “ally”. 
Also we must not forget that even if you dont believe it, feminism isnt the antagonist of patriarchy."
 @jacobsteinberg7702  you're sneaky
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz well, they can Sweetie"
Exactly what I thought during the start of the video
 @mijangos.4818  Men cant have their own opinions. Omgomgomg you're so right
Yup
Ari Mijangos Ruiz actually sweetie there are several feminist activist who are male that you can see on tv all the time talking about the issue from a man's perspective.
Jacob Steinberg you aren’t a feminist sorry your gonna have to change your gender for that
 @mijangos.4818  i consider myself as soup
"Tell me when feminism gave a crap about men. If it ever did, how often did it happen?
Tell me, if you are a woman, did you ever look at most men THE SAME way you would look at most women - as in - did they feel the same way to you?

If the answer is negative to both of these questions, then the sort of equality you're fighting for, is IMPOSSIBLE to achieve.

Now, do women have at least as many rights as men do? Yes. So, take your feminism and go to the muslim countries with it."
" @roknroller6052  Those people are not feminists. They can call themselves feminists all they want, but they do not fit the definition of the feminist ideology. Misandry has no more place among feminists than misogyny does.
I am male, and wholeheartedly support real feminism, not the misandrist nonsense than misogynists attempt to stereotype the entirety of the feminist movement as being."
" @23Starcatcher  Voting rights, right to own property or work, right to be considered human beings, get the picture?"
" @lambsypte4482  alpha males are a myth, buddy."
" @mattcary8075  I'd rather be seen as a ""simp"" by misogynists than be a misogynist myself. I support equality. That's what true feminism seeks."
" @masterchiefpettyofficerspa3646  Regardless, they should have the same rights."
Jeana Geertgens for real I’m a women and no way in hell a feminist
"@missingno miner... Leaving the frankly psychos out as that's probably as much mental illness. The very people you're saying are not feminists, Are the voice and face of feminism (politics, social media, media, hollywood, academia) and the people you're claiming are real feminists have no voice and are faceless. So at what point does the hijacked instantiated form of the ideology replace the original unrepresented form!?... Plus I agree with Jordan Peterson that the emancipation of women was sanitary related more than a result of a few women over 100yrs ago..."
" @mijangos.4818  you need men who are feminists if this whole movement is going to work out, sweetie"
 @mijangos.4818  they litterally can
" @Missingno_Miner  
These days they are ."
 @mijangos.4818  incorrect
Just to clear this up. Feminists dont hate men we believe woman and men should be treated equally. All genders can be feminists. 💪
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz, Yes they can sweetie."
Bengiamino do you know what a feminists are?
" @anna.9027 
Problem is these feminist are speaking for you and only fight for female rights.
This is what feminist have become because of them and are being hated because of it."
Lambsy Pte i will agree there are some toxic feminists who believe woman should be more important almost but there are tons of singers/bands who are feminists in the equality Way ( eg. Little mix) that is the type of feminists i was talking about
Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes they can?
"@Valeria Vargas There is absolutely toxic feminism, but what that is, and what you're talking about, seems to more be misandrists labeling themselves as feminists, which has been happening in more and more and putting a bad face to feminism. Men can be feminists because men can believe in equal rights. It's okay to believe in equal rights without labeling yourself a feminist too. Misandry and misogyny, the ideas of gender superiority, are the issues that need to be battled."
 @valeriaprezas4014  The definition of feminism is gender equality. Someone else even copy-pasted the exact definition in a comment. I don't understand what your interpretation of the definition was.
" @anna.9027  
But these are not the people who are in the news making feminist look bad and until females stop them from abusing feminist the movement will keep being abused by them and all will only be seen as man haters.
The same as 2 of the guys there are not what i would call alpha men and the people who made this know it ."
That would have been dope
I don’t think gender matters in intellectual debates / conversations
" @joshuataylor2002  
No matter how smart you are ,nothing is better than experience and if you are born one or the other then you are going to have more experience knowing what it is to be a woman or a man.
As a man i have no idea what it is like to conceive  a child , so it makes sense to ask a woman who knows more right?"
i totally agree with you. i was just thinking about this actually
"Lambsy Pte that’s called an argument from authority, and it’s a logical fallacy that is used to shut down debate. Ether an idea is good or an idea is bad. If it’s bad then explain why the idea is bad not just because the presenter has the wrong gender"
That would be firee
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz 
They can tho"
Wow I cant  believe that you thought of that good thinking
 @sofam9645  😀👍
"@Ari Mijangos Ruiz 
Yes they can, they’re called Simps"
 @mijangos.4818  I'm a man who is a feminist and I know that you are clearly a woman who is not a feminist.
" @mattcary8075  sImP. Bro, you haven't broguth any arguments to the table. It's ok to be a male feminist because feminism is about equality."
 @mijangos.4818  is that a joke
Exactly my thoughts.
"rtuyoization , so you would like to take some rights away from men? What would that look like in practice, give me an example? You realize men and women have them same rights as it’s written legally, right?"
Pantelis Keravnikes nah bro feminism used to be about women being equal now its about putting women above men and calling everything sexist
" @alexmatthew3863  English have the word call ""egalitarianism"""
 @roknroller6052  those type of feminists are the winnsboro Baptist church of christians.
"@Jenn Jutsu... That doesn't make any sense if it's bible based religion, As what they are saying is in opposition to the bibles message. 

Talking about a patriarchy when you believe in a God that made man in his image, Haha.. 

Talking about racism or multiculturalism when you believe in a God, That purposefully segregated humanity by language and breaking up the worlds singular continent into the many continents for humanities preservation, The parable, Tower of Babel... 

Those girls are no more Christian than I am (I'm not).. Haha"
As a female anti-feminist I’d like to participate as a female man rights activist tbh
Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes they can
Bengiamino Feminism means equality for woman not that all men are bad and woman are better
Exactly because I would’ve been on the men’s right side.
 @mijangos.4818  they most certainly can.
Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes we can
 @mijangos.4818  I mean i wouldn't support it but for some reason some men want to be
"Jenn Jutsu... Haha, I thought you were being literal about a certain group of feminists... 🤔🙄😂 

I encounter so many idiots online it makes me dumber lmao...

I'm not familiar with that reference, 'I was just thinking Christians?! Really!' 🤣🤣🤣"
Alot of simps agreed
Exactly
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz simps can, tho"
Ari Mijangos Ruiz i am a male feminist. they do exist
Ari Mijangos Ruiz I’m a feminist. I just don’t support the feminism that takes place in The USA since technically were already equal.
 @roknroller6052  Oh no its fine!! lol I was just SOO confused at first. I completely understand.. I mean.. this is the internet after all
 @sofam9645  you're confusing humanism with feminism femenism deals exclussvly in women's rights
You do get men who are feminists but you don't really get women who are mras
 @Bengiamino  not all feminists hate men and I'm a man and I'm a feminist I think men and woman are equal and should be treated both with respect unless one of the men or women did something wrong then they should not be treated with respect
 @Bengiamino  sorry if it's a bit confusing English isn't really my first language
@Valeria Vargas not all feminists are toxic tho but the majority is
 @Rhychardsantos  they can
Emma Flatt actually a feminist is someone who is advocating for women’s rights. Has nothing to do with being male or female.
"@Kara M... What? 🤣🤣🤣 




It matters..."
"3rd wave feminism, I thought everyone knew what that was"
" @sofam9645  thats an old fashion definiton. A movement is defined by its actions. No matter how hard women and feminists want to be recalled as an equal rights movement, their actions are what defines Feminism. Feminism, based on the general approach nowaddays, is an extremist men hating group. Since it has so much media publicity it still survives to this day"
Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes they can
AlexMatthew Women have certain entitlements as well
bruno lopes... Agreed
It shouldn't matter?
Ari Mijangos Ruiz oh yes they can
"""went along""? Weird phrasing."
" @mijangos.4818  And you, madam, are part of the problem."
Yes
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz and you can’t be right, sweetie"
Ari Mijangos Ruiz yea they can
Jeana Geertgens and a guy who's feminist
"That’s exactly how I felt, frankly disagree with 95% of what the women say and I honestly agree soooooo much more with the men, and I’m a woman."
Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes they can it’s literally supporting women’s rights u don’t have to be a girl
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz Yes they can, sweetie"
Me too I was thinking about that before I pressed the video and during the whole thing
" @mijangos.4818  Oh fuck, the radfem take."
" @thesoliloquist1940  You're absolutely correct. Just because some of the people in a community go too far, that shouldn't bring down the entire movement."
 @mijangos.4818  please please PLEASE tell me you're joking
Thought the exact same. They throw guy in yellow in there just to make men’s rights look as fringe as it could.
Yes! I thought about that too
Valeria Vargas maybe the people you surround itself with are toxic?
Giorgos Andrigiannakis men and women should be equal. That’s a good thing about men.
Lord McBucket  but women still aren’t equal to men. That’s why instead of a feminist I consider myself an “equalitarian” it advocates for women and men.
Valeria Vargas you do know that proliferation post big signs of aborted fetuses and yell at women going into the clinics to traumatize them. You can’t base a whole group off just a small percentage.
Jeana Geertgens indeed
Jeana Geertgens EXACTLY
 @mijangos.4818  LOL you are so wrong
 @jacobsteinberg7702  it used to be like that but feminism took a dark turn
 @sofam9645  lol that's YOUR opinion of feminism. There are plenty of women out there that would go further and believe that women should be the center of the universe and essentially above men..
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz, “a person who supports feminism”. That is the definition of a feminist. The definition of feminism is “the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.” Your comment is pretty much saying men cannot think that Men and Woman are equal, and also cannot think that women deserve rights."
 @mijangos.4818  wtf- that's not how it works-
Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes they can wtf
Valeria Vargas any links or sources about the Argentina thing.
"Jacob Steinberg I LOVE YOU.  Please don’t ever think that feminists hate men, we just hate incels."
Bengiamino Hahaha.. he called you a toad.
Ari Mijangos Ruiz anyone can fight for the equal rights.
 @sofam9645  so why does the defenition change when I ask a different person? People who belive in femenisim belive that WOMENS rights are the only ones that are being oppressed hence the latin prefix femin = woman And egalitarian is someone who believes in being equal. People are sheepish enough to belive anything they hear from a freind or some gay buzzfeed article. Men rights activists believe that men have struggles. Middle eastern countries need to be equal with men and women. Not by being a feminist but by being equal.
 @annalptk2697  exactly
Ari Mijangos Ruiz well clearly you don't know harry styles
" @lilyf-g5584  isnt that just being egalitarian? Feminism by its name the Fem part is for focusing on womens issues which is just one side of the same coin in my opinion. Same thing for Mens rights. It's just focusing on guys issues. 
Why make all these words and sub categories up when you can just say your egalitarian? Much easier imo

And plus he term Male feminist seems to have some negative connotations to it as well.

Dont mean to sound rude if it came off that way to you. Just wanted to share my opinion. Have a good day mate^^"
 @stevenchilds861  I never understood that toxic masculinity part. Its seems like a nebulous term to me. What's toxic about masculinity? I never hear anything about the opposite. Not being mean I just genuinely want to know.
What???
 @jacobsteinberg7702  You called them a toad... You're freakin awesome 😂👏🏾
"@Valeria Vargas I'm so sorry you had to go through that. I always thought feminism just meant ""equality for all"" because I've never seen any feminist say anything hateful about the other gender. I just want everyone to be treated equally, I don't care what or who you are. In my eyes we are all human who all deserve respect. You didn't deserve to be treated any differently then anyone else."
I feel like there should be a dude that doesn’t know anything about either side and he should just say what makes sense in his mind
Wait those exsist
@Valeria Vargas  why cant a male be a feminist never have I ever thought that feminist was a way for men to be down.Feminist is where both men and woman are equal.I think that a woman should be equal not in terms of male standered but shine in parts where they are unique in like child birth.
In my eyes every country have right instead of Latin America or some part of Arabian Country. But I saw Faminist who want woman to be more rights than men that give me headache to me..
Ari Mijangos Ruiz I— Okay. 🤧
 @bbb7863  Femenisim is an ever changing defenition but it's real definition ( in Latin prefix and postfix) = Female Belief. Where does male come in? Especially since it's purpose was created for womens rights.
@rtuyoization wtf are you talking about? Care to elaborate?
 @annalptk2697  lol the legal system is more against men than it is women
" @mijangos.4818  Actually they can. Feminism is just about being a strong advocate for woman's rights. If you wholeheartedly call yourself a feminist, and strongly believe in the ideology, than you are in fact a feminist. Personal gender has nothing to do with ideological belief."
Yesss 👏👏👏
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz I feel as though they can because isn’t it about the ideology more than who you are? I mean, I think it’s similar to being a white person who supports the civil rights movement and vice versa."
Camila Torres I agree. It would be similar to white people supporting the civil rights movement and vice versa...it’s simply an ideology
carlee garat 👏👏👏
carlee garat PREACH
Ari Mijangos Ruiz was that a joke?
How is it that I just thought that and here you are?
 @roknroller6052  feminism is literally all about equality..? that's the point lmao
 @mijangos.4818   do you know what a feminist is ?Feminism is about woman's rights whatever ur gender is u can support woman
 @mijangos.4818  brutha what r u talking bout
 @Bengiamino  ew ur rude
 @jacobsteinberg7702  most of them do
Ari Mijangos Ruiz men definitely can be feminists ..
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz men can, in fact, be feminists. if a man wants equality between women, men, etc then they are.. sweetie"
"Valeria Vargas sorry to break it to you but it sounds like you are a feminist. if someone who is a “feminist” hates on men then she/he is sexist. everything in this world that we live in is alredy about race and gender so how can we avoid it. please, tell me."
RoKn ROLLeR it is literally the definition of it. feminism is about wanting and fighting for equality between all genders.
 @sofam9645  feminism is inherently a sexist term
"Jacob Steinberg, feminazis do"
"AlexMatthew, that already are equal. There is nothing men can do now that women can’t."
"rtuyoization, no we all have the exact same rights and if you actually believe that in today’s age we’re not equal rights wise your ignorant"
"Sunakshi XxXxXxXx, you just blindly follow what you hear on the internet huh? The wage gap is a statistic that has to do with the kind and the amount of work and has nothing to do with gender"
"Lily Fowke-Green, lots and I’d even go as far to say most do"
"Pacific Productions, uh.... yes they do."
"Anna., do you know what a grammar is?"
"Valeria Vargas 
Everyone stans a smart lass!"
" @mijangos.4818  uhh, yes they can bruh"
Ari Mijangos Ruiz it really depends on ones character and how they label themselves. It’s opinion rather than enforcement
" @mijangos.4818  there are different waves of feminists, different categories n all that. a handful of current day feminists hate men, and think women are devalued in society. from another standpoint, feminism could be wanting both men and women to be equally valued in society. it really just depends on what you believe feminism is. men can be feminists. men can support women and support other men as well."
"my thoughts exactly. if we're really trying to look at a diverse spectrum of opinions then men who support gender equality/ vice versa should be represented as well. because a lot of men are like this in real life,, as many bad men as there are there are also good men as well !"
"Both would have been great 
... better if that girl took derick's place."
i would've been the female men's activist
Jacob Steinberg “you toad” 🤣
genius
Ari Mijangos Ruiz how? men can still want women and men to be equal
Ari Mijangos Ruiz i bet u run a zoe laverne fanpage
I opened comment-section for this video...to write the same comment ☺️
No wtf
Oh sh*t so how is the feminist man
"I definitely agree. I am a woman but I think that, at this point in America, by law, women and men are equal but treated unequally."
Yess
 @mijangos.4818  men can indeed be feminists
 @mijangos.4818  feminist is a man or a woman who fights for equality between genders....this have been taught even in schools🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
@Valeria Vargas wtf..where do u live...i want to kno ur place...i want come and live there...the place where i live is so shitty and we dont have equal ryts....we r still suppressed by men...please tell me where u live
"@Valeria Vargas No, I would exclude people, whether male or female, whose stated views go against the definition of the movement. Misandry just so happens to go against what feminism is about, equality."
Yeah such as Sydney Watson would've been a really good choice. Especially to replace over Derrick because I really don't agree with a good portion of what he said. Most of what he said was just not at all good. What the other two have said I'd agree much nre with and it seems they have more of a reason to be there but he's just a simple youtuber with what seems no real reason or knowledge to really be there and present a good argument
Jacob Steinberg same
Ari Mijangos Ruiz men can be feminist
Yes! It would have made this 10x better.
" @mijangos.4818  Yes they can, dear.
How ignorant."
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes they can, sweetie. You don’t have to be a women to be a feminist"
" @mijangos.4818  yes they can, feminism means equality of both genders and lifting the oppression of women and getting rid of the patriarchy, all things men can do"
" @roknroller6052  i feel like you are confusing feminism with misandry, real feminists dont think they are better than men and if they do then they are feminists"
"@G Aguirre... The thing with ideologies like feminism and progressivism, Is people can't just project their ideas of progress onto progressivism and then state as fact that is the definition. Or feminists can't just project their ideas of equality onto feminism. It's dangerous because people empower the label and promote these extremist ideologies that they don't understand, They are projecting their internal barometer of logic and reason and their moderation on to (example) progressivism when in actual fact it's Underlyingly disguised and regurgitated Marxist ideals, Which let's not forget led humanity to the horror of the the gulags which btw killed more people than the Nazis..."
 @mijangos.4818  I think that men can be feminist if they believe in feminism or their own beliefs under the guidelines of equal rights.
i would be very sad to see a women agreeing with the men's rights movement
 @mijangos.4818  everyone should be feminist
That would be interesting
" @gaguirre5345  
Wrong.
Feminism is the advocacy of women's rights but what happens when the equality mark has been reached.
The wage gap due to discrimination is a myth. STEM fields are mostly not a woman's choice because they are mostly not interested in it."
" @sciahddarif2159  
Then what do you call the behavior of the Women in this video?
Controlling what Men say and do.
Referring it as Toxic masculinity. 
Brainwashing them at a young age so they aren't ""Toxic."""
" @LebronIsMyKing1617  Feminism is about supporting and empowering people. It is about birth control access, gender-based violence, people with disabilities and other marginalized people. It is about the overwhelming statistic that women are 50 per cent more likely to get misdiagnosed by a doctor than men are, because women are ofteen seen as dramatic or hysterical to doctors when describing symptoms."
" @mijangos.4818  they can, all feminism is, is the support of female rights."
Jacob Steinberg ☺️😊😊
"Jeana Geertgens Ive met a lot of male feminists, but no female men's rights activists. I think that says something about the different ideologies."
 @Bengiamino  YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW what feminisim is Bro😂
That is absolutely true! As a female I am on the men’s right side of this argument. I do personally think that feminism is needed! But not at the aggression that it is at today where some women are being very toxic and plainly disgusting towards men because they were being nice or supportive to feminism or anything like that
"I feel Men who identify as feminists are mostly sexual predators. They are signaling to real feminists. Real feminists only need to talk to men and not at men. We don't want to be told how to act any more than women do. We want and need to hear your stories, so we can empathize and sympathize. That's how you change the way men act. Also, tell other men when a man is being a POS, we are out there ready to help."
"Jacob Steinberg there’s so such thing. Feminism is from women and for women, sure you can be an ally but don’t be part of a fight that’s not yours"
Ari Mijangos Ruiz since when?
Ari Mijangos Ruiz men can be feminists sweetie
Wouldve made things interesting not gonna lie
"i agree, that's what i expected and i was a bit disappointed with the choices. there are plenty women who contribute to and propel toxic masculinity forward, while many men believe in and support the feminist movement. it would have resonated more with the men here especially (who were very quick to discount the overall female experience) to hear definitions and pro-opinions of feminism from someone they view as an equal in the first place."
" @mijangos.4818  ofcourse they can, sweetie."
" @mijangos.4818  well honey, they can be"
" @mijangos.4818  um yess they can , I believe a woman should have the same rights as men in many categories, as I grew up with a single mom working her ass off to feed me and my sis everyday and came to this country to give us a better future. I also didnt grow up with a male role model in my life and had to learn my ideals and ideology from my mom and aunts and I honestly think that there is such thing as toxic masculinity cause I feel bad for my cousins cause if there caught crying there punished for it and I wish I could of helped them in those times."
"It’s quite unfair to the Men’s Rights group that they brought in an incel (Daniel). They are the extreme fringes of that movement, and if they brought in an incel for the men’s rights group, they should have brought in a radical feminist."
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes they can, sweetie"
Bengiamino feminist don’t hate men. The ones who “hate men” are just people who don’t understand what feminism is
"Ngl but from the thumbnail, I thought Derrick was a girl that was a men’s right activist😂"
Us bros call male feminists simps
Jacob Steinberg they basically do
Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes they can.
Bengiamino being a feminist doesn’t mean you hate men.
abby nicole that doesn’t excuse the fact feminism is wrong
"@Valeria Vargas no, that's incorrect. feminism means believing that both women and men are equal. Anybody can be a feminist, being a feminist does not mean that you hate the other gender. There is no competition. I don't know how you got competition out of feminism.
You said if we could appreciate people for their character not their sex and race right? But you're disagreeing with Feminism, which means that you think women aren't equal as men, how can somebody know if a female is good if they believe that her WHOLE gender is not as good as the other gender??"
Avery Jones that was 30 years ago feminism is different now
" @mijangos.4818  they can be and should be able to be. feminism initially started as an equality  driven movement that petitioned for equality in all rights including racial, sexuality, and gender. It just had a rather unfortunate biased sounding name. The problem is that radicals in feminism set a new tone and that is no longer the case. Feminism has transformed into a Women Rights movement which is biased to their own agenda, which resulted in the creation of the Men's Rights movement (for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction).

Personally I consider myself an Egalitarian (Equalist) I believe that everyone should be equal but I am not necessarily sure how that would work. Currently I believe nobody is equal, injustices are everywhere and that the only thing we are equal in is our inequality itself. Men and Women both have problems but neither are necessarily worse than the others. People just struggle to put themselves in the others shoes, think ""The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.""

The big thing for me is women's example of the fear of being raped, but they never realise that men make those same considerations for entirely different but essentially the same reasons... Safety. I'm a 6ft1 male and I would not feel in the slightest bit safe walking down the street in a miniskirt, in fact I am fairly certain that I may end up with a bottle smashed on the back of my head.  Nor would I do it in a skin tight outfit. In fact many males wear baggy clothes to make themselves look bigger."
 @jacobsteinberg7702  BETAA!
Ari Mijangos Ruiz men can absolutely be feminists. Feminism is about equal rights across genders.
Ari Mijangos Ruiz they certainly can.
Ari Mijangos Ruiz do...do you know what feminism is?
 @mijangos.4818  I'm a man and I consider myself a feminist 100% and agreed with these women statements 100% as well
Maria Petkova most men are feminists???!!! What?😂😂😂
"RoKn ROLLeR those ppl who say that aren’t feminists, they are sexist"
"Valeria Vargas those ppl aren’t feminists, have you searched up the definitions? Those women who burn the churches are sexist"
"23Starcatcher they don’t blame men, it was created by men. Like World War 2, it was created my a man."
"RoKn ROLLeR maybe not in the USA or other countries, but other developing countries may have the gender pay gap. Remember this study was done around the world, not only in the developed countries that have full communities and societies."
Ari Mijangos Ruiz yeah you can...
 @alexisreyes8111  whats it called?
 @sofam9645  by that logic then feminists=egalitarian=men's right movement. Both movements believe in the same thing they just focus on one gender more than the other.
Spitzkopf go to @romaarmy on instagram. She is one of the largest women “Men’s rights” activists today
"@Ari Mijangos Ruiz this comment is sexist in of itself. You are stating that NO MAN is allowed to believe that women are allowed the same rights as men (because I sure as hell do). But while I do believe women are equal to men, I also believe that the feminist movement now is specifically made so women may have the “upper hand” in society. In this video one of the women mention the wage gap problem. This has been disproved due to the face that women use stats on ALL JOBS. Studies have shown that men do hold the majority in higher paying jobs. And when you compare 100 high paying jobs that men have, and 100 lower paying jobs that women have. Obviously the wage gap will be different. But if you were to take the same job, payment, and number of employees. The pay is almost identical. Yes some might say “but male employers will most likely hire men. Making it so women can’t get those higher paying jobs.” That’s because many men are afraid to hire women. In society all a women has to do is say “he raped me” or “he attacked me” without any evidence. When they do that it absolutely destroys a mans reputation, trust, life, and job. And even if all the evidence comes back false, this is still on his record and he would most likely get fired. But while I don’t believe in the current direction of the feminist movement, I do believe men and women should be equal. But to be equal, the feminist movement needs to accept that men still have an incredible amount of problems and that they aren’t the only ones that have it bad. While yes, women had it worse in the past (nobody can disprove that), it is turning to a point where women are the ones becoming power hungry.                                                                                                                                                                      Thank you for coming to my ted talk."
" @mijangos.4818  men participates in the history of feminism right from the start... figures like: Jeremy Bentham, Nicolas de Condorcet and most important: François Poullain de la Barre."
 @mijangos.4818  Haha yes they can I know heaps
"Men's rights???
I have enough rights."
"I feel like there are more problems for men then for women  right now in the  country I live in  . I just want the legal problems to be fixed . We are all basically disposable ,   we aren't  real men unless women    validate us as such  based in their   very high expectations .The law is in favour of women ,   everything from war ( in which we are disposable again )  and   divorce . A single man can impregnate 10 women. If at least 100 men survived and all of them did that we would make  back the population no time    ,but  women need to be protected so that   we can reproduce like that.   Basically we are disposable   as  as long as   a few men exist we can  re-populate   while if one woman dies we already go down a lot in population , and   if  10 women die we  already lost too many . Having a lower life expectancy  only causes a bit of  anxiety , but the legal problems in divorce   , the  fact that   women abusing men  is never  taken seriously  and our manliness being decided by women with high expectations  ( as well as men never being complimented ) makes people suicide .   honestly if I ever get hurt by a woman  and beaten up I would hit her back  since that's  actual  equality     , but most men would loose their job if they did that .biggest fear of mine is  being falsely   accused of rape and going to jail as well as getting my children taken away from me since  people  think    fathers are less important  . Also I don't  want to be seen as a pedophile while going to the park  with my  kids  , but   I am gonna  stop complaining here, after all men shouldn't   complain"
Ari Mijangos Ruiz Bruh moment
Ari Mijangos Ruiz that’s is so far from true and is divisive. You don’t sound like a true feminist rn girl
Jacob Steinberg “toad” 😂
Interesting idea it could work
I was looking for this comment. Cause I was thinking that this video make it seems like feminist is a girl movement and mens rights is only men. But that's false
 @mijangos.4818  Yes they can. No feminist has ever said they can't. Emma Watson even said that and she wants more men to become feminists.
 @Bengiamino  feminists don't hate men they just want to be treated equally.
 @mijangos.4818  Anyone can be a feminist. Feminism is simply believing equality between the sexes.
Ari Mijangos Ruiz I’m sorry what. It’s equal rights activism anyone can activate for that.
 @mijangos.4818  thats  lie ?
I’m a girl and I’m all for men’s rights
Ari Mijangos Ruiz stop spreading this narrative men can be feminist
Ari Mijangos Ruiz they can indeed.
 @mijangos.4818  i am a man and i am a feminist wtf
 @Bengiamino  do you even know what a feminist is?
@Valeria Vargas do you even know what feminism is?
 @roknroller6052  yes it does it is literally that
 @Rhychardsantos  yes they can
 @roknroller6052  u mad bb :c so sad
A pick me?
"@Nicolasho... Yeah, drink that Kool-Aid"
"Wow 434 replies and people are still commenting, Who's gonna read all of this, lmao"
I agree
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz LoL, learn the original concept of feminism in the first place. I’m a man who considers myself a feminist."
Yeah that’s what I was just thinking
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz yes haha, they can. Feminism is only about equality. A person who wants equality is a feminist"
"Hajna Takats while that’s technically what feminism is, it has gained this toxic quality that makes it seem as though it’s more that women are better than men. Kind of what people assume men’s rights activists are like. (I’m all for equality but I don’t stray to a particular side)"
"Ari Mijangos Ruiz you don’t need to be patronising, sweetie"
"Id consider myself mens rights as a woman because the modern definition of the feminist movement has become skewed to the point we are forgetting about the men.
It's about how women are treated unjustly to so many things but forget men are targets of sexism as well. Both sexes are targets and it seems many modern feminists forget that. They see what women go through and say ""Men are not targeted like that so why are we?"" But dont listen when men say ""Women are not targeted like that so why are we?""
Women hold men accountable while not holding themselves accountable for the same things.
It's against women to stare at a womans chest but not against men to do the same.
I agree there should be been the other sex on both sides because of those stereotypes that all women are feminists and all men arent."
 @sofam9645  Im pretty sure the definition of Feminism is a women's rights advocate
"and they would definetely have to swap out derrick with a female mens rights activist, because he made everyone hate him... which is bad for the objective representation of the mens rights side"
 @mijangos.4818  Yes they do pls don't dicourage it...
 @Bengiamino  wth... feminism is believing that all genders deserve to be equal not hating men. STOP.
@Valeria Vargas WTH DID YOU READ ANY OF OTHER COMMENTS DEFINING FEMINISM?
 @mijangos.4818  why not? I'm a guy and I support the original ideology of feminism
"@Valeria Vargas I know your comment was 3 months ago, but there isn't a movement in those countries because they all would get killed. I know it's a tough concept for you to grasp, but not everyone has freedom of speech where they can have an open conversation without punishment. Read Malala if you actually want to open yourself up to the idea that women have tried to gain rights in those countries, but she was shot for speaking out about it"
"@Valeria Vargas  ""it's only women who victimize themselves"" you victimize yourself at the end of your comment. The only evidence you provide is purely anecdotal."
" @jacobsteinberg7702  Man calling someone a toad? He was asking a question. Also, this kind of proves his point in a way. Not trying to hate, just pointing out something for you."

"Giorgos Andrigiannakis men should be able to show their emotions and wear skirts and traditionally feminine clothing if they want to, that’s somethings feminists have said, we believe all genders should be equal"
Kai Molina ok “pick me” girl
Same I really want to see they’re reasons I’d find it interesting
" @giorgosandrigiannakis1375  the belief of it is for men and women to be equal, doesn't mean the people now believe this."
" @mijangos.4818  feminism isn’t inherently about giving power to only women. Hear me out. It’s about giving power to femininity. Obviously, in society, there is a lot of crossover between women and what’s considered feminine but feminism is also about creating a safe space for men (and most certainly women as well) to do things that are considered feminine and bring power to those things. Any person in a suit looks “powerful”, but people wearing dresses is considered “pretty” but powerless. Women are still incredibly oppressed in society, and men showing any signs of vulnerability or femininity is considered weak. The larger issue at hand is obviously allowing women to feel safe, especially women of colour, but feminism stands for far more than just that. This isn’t meant to be an attack on anyone either, I just hate to see people saying “men can’t be feminists” when the feminism isn’t a women only group. It’s not a club. It’s a movement. A movement that should be supported by every individual in my eyes."
" @mijangos.4818  yes... yes they can... feminists is a movement to have equality for both genders, mentally and physically. you just stereotyped all men..."
 @Bengiamino  that’s not what feminists mean —
 @roknroller6052  no.. that’s not what feminists are for. feminists are for equality for both genders. women see men as men and boys as boys
 @mijangos.4818  wtf? That's so wrong
"Because these are not actual feminists, these are ""feminists"""
 @Bengiamino That’s not what feminism is.
 @mijangos.4818  yes they can you have just been wrongly educated
 @mijangos.4818  yes they can lmao. everyone should be a feminist. it’s literally the belief that men and women should be equal
 @mijangos.4818  i’m gonna assume you don’t know what feminism means but it means the equality between the 2 genders (and non binary) so men can and should be feminists
 @mijangos.4818  yes they definitely can’t feminism is all about wanting to be equal so yes men can fight For women to be equal to them
 @mijangos.4818  yes they can
 @mijangos.4818  Bish what are you on about??  Of course they can!!
 @mijangos.4818  men can be feminists
Like Karen Straughan
 @mijangos.4818  yes they can?? Femisinim isn’t women vs men it’s people vs the patriarchy
Yes.
 @Bengiamino  the definition of feminism is equal rights for all genders
" @mijangos.4818  Yes they can, that is so embarrassing that you think they can’t."
I just like to call myself an equalist
 @mijangos.4818  yes they can there are men out there who are fighting for women’s rights
 @Bengiamino  so you hate men?
 @mijangos.4818  yes they can sweetie
 @roknroller6052  your idiocy is taller than the empire state building
 @mijangos.4818  bro what?? Do you even understand what feminism is
 @mijangos.4818  why not?
feminism means the belief that men and women are equal. if you believe that and fight for both sides’ rights those are feminist views. being a feminist has nothing to do with one gender being better than the other.
" @mijangos.4818  feminism is the belief that men and women should be equal/treated the same, and that women have the control over their own bodies. that belief isn’t limited for only women to believe, men can have that belief too."
YASSS
" @mijangos.4818  No mam, all men aren't same."
 @mijangos.4818  what are you talking about.
 @jacobsteinberg7702  yes they do.
 @mijangos.4818  yes they can??
 @jacobsteinberg7702  lol beta
 @Bengiamino  feminism is like blm it’s not saying that one group is superior to another but it’s advocating for a group that is treated unfairly or unequally
 @mijangos.4818  They can.
 @sofam9645  Weird that it's called FEMinism and not equalitism or equality.
 @mijangos.4818  that's not true
" @mijangos.4818  they can support them tho, you say you want men to understand you but then you get mad when they try?"
 @sofam9645 o
 @mijangos.4818 men can be feminist what are you talking about lol
 @mijangos.4818 wrong? I’m not a feminist but yeah it’s possible
I would love to argue on the men’s side.
​ @roknroller6052 I know that this comment was years ago and you probably won't even see this but the literal definition of feminism is equal rights for both genders so I don't know what you think it is
​ @Bengiamino being a feminist does not mean hating men..
​ @roknroller6052 right it has everything to do with hating Men and down with the patriarchy.  No. That's progressive feminism. Real feminism is EQUALITY for all. Not equity.
I don't get what people hate about Derrick.

@Destiny Squire do that for your English exam jesus christ
@Destiny Squire I fully agree with you! I have never seen it phrased so well. Thank you for making my day with that one <3
"@Destiny Squire I don't really see why you can't take affirmative action like you suggested AND complain in public spaces like this. I don't know what the women in this video do in their day to day lives to combat sexism, all I see is this. Both can be effective tools. The thing with this video is that (besides Derrick) they fundamentally didn't disagree with each other. It sounded like the issues the women faced were much more personal, common and social. While the men didn't often face issues personally but recognised some of the biases against men and wanted to fight against them. That's where it gets a bit confusing, since both clearly have a reason to exist, but both sides seemed not to what the others movement to exist. Mostly, it seems, because of the more extreme elements of the other's movements. Some of the feminists seemed to think that mens rights activism shouldn't exist, but recognised systemic issues men face. She appeared to think that feminism itself would deal with it and men can't have a movement of their own to tackle it."
"@Destiny Squire Yeah, I think it's a bit of a fault with this video's format. They didn't really get anywhere, and didn't really try to find a middle ground. To your point though, in many ways I think talking to random people is a good way to go about it. These are the people who aren't going to equality groups, aren't active in these kinds of fields. Another thing is to be careful about generalisation. When claims are made against men in general, even if it's understood it's not everyone, you instantly put a person on the defensive even if they haven't done anything wrong. When you talk about bad actions rather than groups then you can reach agreement with like minds.


Take the statement ""Men often feel they can grab a woman without consent"". Even though it's worded in a way which says it's not everyone, and may not be you, it still sparks defensiveness, and the response might be that it's not just men. If instead we framed it ""Too many people feel they can grab another person without their consent"", then I can easily agree with that even if I know that group of people is primarily men. It's best just not to push your supporters onto the other side. Even terms like Feminism and Patriarchy do that."
"It's kinda sad how most feminists are just shoving ""females are superior"" down people's throats. Come on, our ancestors didn't fight for our rights just for you to make us look so bad in society."
Destiny Squire I get what you mean. It was a little confusing to me at first but I fully agree.
I D K exactly. That isn’t going to do any good for anyone.
Derrick was the outlier for sure. Didn't add to the conversation at all .
Feminism

 @wolframeickerestinpeace2562  I'm sorry what 😃
"@Destiny Squire I agree with you so goddamn much. Although one little problem. For America, your whole essay's 100% correct, and that the rights in America should probably stay like this as there are solutions to deal with problems each, rather than starting riots on the streets. But it doesn't apply with the rest of the world. For example, Vietnam have been getting more cases of 16 year old girls getting raped in elevators, staircases for when there's a fire, schools, ect. But, Vietnam has a rule of not allowing people to bring self-defense items, like pepper sprays. They are illegal, so the women and girls there can't defend themselves against men who try to harm them, and vice versa. May I ask you how you are going to get out of this one? What if the victim didn't have friends? Even if they report, the damage's already done, the emotional scar is there, if the victim's female that's even worse with a chance of them being pregnant, and there's a high chance the prepertrator would just get away."
 @wolframeickerestinpeace2562  he looks like the dude who lives in his mom's basement
"Sure they're built to be stronger like lifting things, but in things like finances, medicine and other jobs women are just as good. They just don't get as many chances as men because some think that they should just stay in the kitchen and raise the children. God created us all equal."
" @luizasargsian4067  FYI it's not ""females are superior"" it's females are equal."
 @laurengracie9107  Why do you think that? Because women went through centuries where it was perfectly FINE for men to hurt women. People are evolving but there will always be people who don't agree. Just like in the BLM movement all cops should treat people equally but there will always be people who hate black or hate female! Have you not heard of george floyd

@Destiny Squire um... do you genuinely think “women do better. fight back against someone who is much stronger and will likely have way more consequence.  do you not understand how much that an escalate a situation clearly not because you’ve never been in one of those kind of situations before. you seriously don’t need to be saying stuff like that and you don’t need to be comparing that to the men’s side whenever it’s not a matter of being raped or not it’s a matter of an opinion.
Men's right 👍
 @bustin9938  9/10 it's totally involuntary. Women don't get the concept because for them finding a partner is just a matter of picking.
No it's actually mens rights activists and feminists vs Derrick

 @wolframeickerestinpeace2562  listen to his words. He's obviously sexist.

Everyone in general was were equal in a negative no one won.
 @wolframeickerestinpeace2562  Hes a clown that was only hired to screw over the other Men's rights guys
" @jamessmith5711  Not everything you say is necessarily true. Your “men protect women” logic is sort incorrect. Not 100% incorrect, but partially incorrect. Why don’t all men become body guards then? Lets be completely honest here, not all men have the bravery, strength and size and genetics to be protective. Maybe Jason Momoa and Dwayne Johnson can,  but not the average guy and especially NOT derrick. Some people aren’t built for that. Some men don’t even feel any protective instinct because they aren’t fighters or feel like its too stressful Bottom line: unless you are jason momoa or The Rock, being “protective” isn’t that exactly their forte."
" @lauracarbonaro5516  I agree, not all men. And average guy on a individual level won't fair well either in protecting, but I mean I would think that's part of the reason why historically most men didn't reproduce and part of why women chase high quality men."
" @jamessmith5711  The main point here is that humans are drastically different. You don’t need to be the biggest and strongest, and that’s a really beautiful thing. Human surpassed some intelligence level where we live happier lives. Humans have evolved with pair bonding, which is why there is so many dynamics in human relationships. Human can bond over many different things, and that’s what makes the most intelligent species, and we are the ones who thrive the most. Men don’t need to fight over females, they simply just find the one girl who they are compatible with. There is literally a mate for everyone, everyone can find someone to bond with. And I think that’s beautiful"
" @lauracarbonaro5516  
I expect gaps in my thinking and some misremembering cause i didn't comb over all the past conversations thoroughly so i apologize if I didn't properly address something.

""Humans have evolved with pair bonding, which is why there is so many dynamics in human relationships.""

We’re not a pair bonding species. Also wouldn't pair bonding actually diminish the number of relationships that can be formed thus simplifying dynamics?

“men don’t need to fight over females they just need to find the one girl they are compatible with.”
People aren’t compatible with just one person and the dating market is highly skewed against men of lower status, if you set up a profile for an average guy and average girl on tinder or any dating app and compare results ,but I think you'd find it apparent with casual research. There are also countries with gender discrepancies especially China making men who don’t measure up effectively untouchables. Also the fact that an example can be found of a woman who would go for these bottom tier men doesn’t mean there’s enough of these women to go around for all these bottom tier men.

“Human can bond over many different things, and that’s what makes the most intelligent species, …”
I don’t see how people bonding over things relates with the ability to and speed in which people can figure things out which is what I thought intelligence was.

So in conclusion, not everyone has enough compatible people to have a reasonable chance at a love life unless there's something important I'm missing.

And the protection argument feels a little to hard to explain or work out for me at the moment so I'll just say that I don't think men have to be THE biggest and strongest just relatively so and its less to do with the reality of protection and more to do with what women tend to be attracted to. And people can still have their own personal preferences which smash right in the face of our evolutionary history too that's fine and i don't have a problem with that I'm just talking more macro rather than micro and those kind of generalizations don't acknowledge variances that are apparent on the individual level."
" @jamessmith5711  No gaps in your response so far, so don’t worry. 

Now back to the argument: how about immigrant fathers who had wives who loved them and stayed by them no matter what? What about girls who were raised in more humbling households where they didn’t develop superficial ideas? What about girls who are close to their fathers and brothers so they are more understanding towards a man’s living situation? Any ideas that people have are developed, no one is “accidentally” born to think that way. That type of thinking is developed"
" @lauracarbonaro5516  “… Any ideas that people have are developed, no one is “accidentally” born to think that way. That type of thinking is developed.”
So I’m guessing the subject of your last argument was how I described women’s thinking that I brought up, but I’m not sure what “that type of thinking” is that you’re referring to exactly so I’m not sure how to respond."
" @jamessmith5711  yes, I am referring to your explanation on women’s thinking. It is developed, which explains how beliefs and ideas are shaped, and can be changed. Anyone can learn to be less superficial, and less spoiled. These superficial ideas are developed since childhood, possibly due to being spoiled by parents since they were little girls. That’s why women who grew up in different households all act different. You will see that women who had a 
more  humble and simple childhood will not be so superficial and greedy. Like I said, those type of thoughts are developed, and a thought can be changed. Even superficial women can learn to humble themselves even if they were spoiled. That’s the beauty of the human consciousness, we can change out thought process in any way we like"
 @lauracarbonaro5516  Could you give me some quotes of what i said about how women think? cause I'm just not connecting the dots on what exactly I said that you’re responding to.
 @wolframeickerestinpeace2562  Really? all the other men seemed so respectful and then there was just .  .  .  Derrick
" @bustin9938  this comment makes absolutely no sense, and it's very disturbing that 300 hundred people liked it. Blaming someone for their misery, loneliness and unattractiveness in any context is just cruel. 
Many things in life are beyond our control, and this is especially true when it comes to physical attractiveness. Even if we can improve ourselves by making a considerable effort, refusing to be emphatic towards unlucky people is unkind.
I should also point out that these efforts are not equally distributed between the sexes."

"Bored Bored bored Well the thing was it was a discussion to allow everyone to share their opinions. Like they said they all have different perspectives, yet they fall under the same vague umbrella of Men’s Rights. And the other two should not be judged based on his comments, they are completely different people with completely yet somewhat similar perspectives."
Who made Derrick the way he is. That's the question you should be asking but you won't because you know the answer
"I don’t know who made him believe that stuff. He was talking in a completely different manner than the other two so I think that he isolated himself from other people while forming his opinions. He was the only MRA that seemed to put women on a subspecies level below men, that’s on him, that does not reflect the same ideas expressed by the other two.🤷🏻‍♂️"
😂 yeah
Derek is not one of us
Ikr
"Oh, and I say that as a guy that loooooaathes MRA's."

I kno right lol
"@Kuuryo so there was a separate convo with Kurusat (hope I'm spelling his name right) where he said Jubilee's original idea was 3 incels vs 3 feminists, but they couldn't find 3 incels willing to participate other than Derrick, so they turned into MRA vs feminists. While he was not a plant, Kurusat also mentioned that they focused a LOT on Derrick on purpose. More than what was appropriate. I'll link to the convo if I find it again."
 @blvckemo_  is he not a grown man? Derrick made Derrick this way. He can't get laid and believes its not his fault.
i was sayin that
" MrVeggie247  proof is a vague concept for you, isnt it?"
" MrVeggie247  I'm amazed, you say so much only to say next to nothing of value. Derrick is a tool who believes his celibacy is not his own fault"
" MrVeggie247  perhaps, but I didn't know my father and I grew up to be...what's not an incel? I don't tune in enough to know their slang. 
Derrick is a grown man, while our upbringing does affect who we are, in this day and age we choose how we think, and he has chosen ignorance."
 MrVeggie247  you think he'll be happier for it. Do you think he's happy?
 MrVeggie247  the reason why I haven't provided much reason for my 'anger' is because I'm not angry. I just see a sad little man who refuses to see past his own self pity.

 @alenkavenx2056  fr tho
 @arnezargarian4583  Why tho? You`re right btw the videos been doctored heavily and the fact he`s there at all is them poisoning the well.
Funny how even through all the lies they couldnt make the women look good. lol
Feminist got put in there place
"they make themselves looks bad by not saying ""i disagree with what Derrick is saying"". the girls even SAID at one point is to say to their peers ""hey, this what you are saying/doing is wrong"""
" @dani010203stor  I'm not sure the producers of the episode wanted that. Derrick was obviously invited for a reason and that was to expres his 'opinion'. And thats all Derrick does, he doesn't address Men's rights, he doesn't try to understand feminism, he is just there to spew out his nonsense, and thats why he was invited. As said in the beginning, despite all being under the umbrella of Men's right activists, they are very different from each other in their views and I would not be surprised that the producers did not want it to become Derrick vs Men's rights activists."
Bruh if I was the other guys I’d be HELLA embarrassed
 @blvckemo_  it’s simply because he is just not well informed on the topic. The other two men seemed to know what they were talking about. He just seems to be hopping on the bandwagon.
People who give the benefit of the doubt to the other two despite them agreeing with many things Derrick said makes me livid.
"Derrick wasn't that bad, he was right in some aspects, he just comes across ass bitter because of his appearance, optics matter, but he was right, we do need a more patriarchal society, it would solve a lot of problems regarding women and society in general"
derrick be making them second-guessing their opinions
Crrrrrrrrrrrrringe
100%
him not them
 @arnezargarian4583  I agree. Something that would also make it better is if they put one female mra and one male feminist. That would be better imo
 @arnezargarian4583  -_-
@Hftt Ghjg but still that can go for (I think her name was Alyssa.... idk sorry) the black woman. She was using her past to form an opinion. It was obvious her experiences were why she is a feminist
 @zackie8172  How exactly? Like what elements will help fix problems and how can you be sure that those problems are caused by women?
 @ayofrtho7014  the feminists didnt do it as well so...
 @sheadoherty7434  lmao yes. 🙌
Pls don’t use God’s name in vain...
The asian guy was visibly dying inside everytime D-boy spoke
" @arnezargarian4583  yeah pretty sure the director behind this is a women so it only makes sense, lol"
Don't use God's name like that. Its insulting
"""Please leave Derrick...Please!"""
 @blvckemo_  his mom? That's the only parental figure we get
facts. The asian seemed very open minded unlike Derrick
 Herr Goober  Its true
"No. In fact, based on how they react with body language when he speaks and how they chained on his points, to prolong them, you can tell they approve most of what he says, they just wont say that themselves, because they figured they are trying to debate overly emotional children. They also recognize Derrick doesnt have much social skills, but thats not even criteria when you have show with children role playing as adults."
 @draculemihawk7945 these sharp looks took me out 😂
Don't use Gods name in vain just use gosh as a replacement word he loves you dearly ❤
"Yeah, I’m pretty sure 99% of the people that are with the other guys just hate Derek"
Just goes to show why fathers are needed in the home
Huh? How is it sad?
 @rnick123 probably still gonna have similar views
it's cause he was raised by a single mother thats why he acts like this
 @jbbeefboss2646  not necessarily
"fr, i was raised by a single mother and i despise every single thing he stands for"
" @rnick123 always had my dad in the home and he didnt do much of anything to help me succeed or lead by example. functioning alcoholic my whole life who is completely closed off mentally and emotionally. a father figure is necessary, but the father themselves often aren’t due to their deadbeat approach and attitude"
"​@JSwett0042 that's just your dad. I know plenty of pos moms, too. ALL the dads i know are great and needed. The exception isn't the rule."
"​ @uncadon3980  no, it's not her fault. He was in a men superior society and obviously now we have so much access to the internet there's absolutely no denying that it was definitely his upbringing. You know, this really reminds me of ""like a compass, a man's finger is always pointing towards a woman."" YES, I am agreeing he needed a father but this is not her fault and I would believe being poor and having children is the climax of their problems"
"​ @arleneeie how can you know for sure? Having a bad mother can lead to a kid having distorted perception of the opposite sex, which could push the kid towards more radical movements."
" @JSwett0042  Then let me guess, you mother has a well paid job."
It's a very common thing actually. I believe that psychologically it's due to the absence of the male figure in the household. They tend to look outward to see how they should act and maybe overly compensate for their masculinity due to not having been taught about manhood more personally by a male figure. Some this happens to but not all. It's all about care and nurturing.
"“I love my mom, but-“ was one of the first things he said and set the groundwork for everything that followed."
Why?
He most likely acts like that BECAUSE he was raised by a single mother.
 @CrimzinEclipse2010  so you’re just gonna fully blame the parent who stayed and actually took care of a child lol
"@rnick123

I have a mom and im perfectly fine , shows nothing now"
"@CrimzinEclipse2010

able to blame it on the woman and not the guy . Its really sad"
 @rnick123 very true
 @rnick123 single mothers are more likely to raise someone who isn’t an incel
" @dustinmoore600  Well, this is just derriks  mom. I have seen many moms which are great and inspire great ideas in their children and not to mention the MANY dads who are heavily alcholic and drug users, beating and ignoring their children."
This goes to show why father's are needed in the home
Meet his mother
"This is the issue: ""single mom"""
"​ @rnick123  no, if a father leaves, he is shitty enough so he wouldnt raise a great kid either"
 @rnick123  and how would that make a difference
​​ @rnick123  No!! It doesn't mean if someone is a single father their child will come out discipline it's not always true or if someone has single mother or maybe both...u r blaming it on one gender that's wrong dude!
​ @JSwett0042 Mamas boy😂
Seems typical to me. Those kids tend not to fare as well.
" @rnick123 Oh, you mean the same fathers that walked out on their kids and abandoned responsibility as a parent? It would be the same if it was a single dad. Being a single parent has nothing to do with gender, both are needed in the household"
​ @uncadon3980  nah it depends on the person the mom is and not that facts that it's just a mom
​ @elig7087  which psychologist? I'm a PhD from usc and we didn't learn that. Neither in my 10 year career did I ever see that.
You can be married and still be a single parent.
literally
acts like what?
Exactly. Asian guy’s definition makes no sense. “Im not saying one is superior” that is the definition of inequality.
 @HoneydewHelen so are you ignorant or defiant because you completely missed what he said he said there not equal is in what there suited for  but equal as humans but fundamentally they do different thing but still make up that even 50%
 @Sekoishere Why do you think the phrasing of the question was “different but equal”? It already accounted for those differences
"You are not aware that the words ""different"" and ""equal"" are mutually exclusive because they mean the exact opposite. George Orwell introduced this way of abusing language in his novel ""1984"". Orwell named it ""Doublethink"": to simultaneously hold to mutually exclusive opinions on a topic. shaping these thought into words builds ""Doublespeak"", e.g. ""war is peace""."
" @Viewable11  i figure what they meant more accurately would be equity. Men and women are both needed in society, we cannot live without the other. They are needed in different things and are therefore equal in that sense"
"⁠ @Sekoishere and that has a name 😂, its called equity"
​ @Viewable11 what's ur point? like actually no argument
" @queenserena99  My point is that the original poster attempted to appear to be an enlightend humanist, but they don't understanding basics of the meaning of words. What they said has the same meaning as claiming ""hot and cold are different but equal"". It's the same nonsense."
Taterman 02 who is Derrick
 @user-gb2ol2cp1n  The incel... the one with the fricking yellow jacket lol
 Julius Songling  haha Wow. Should put that in quotation. Maybe the lady on the left would have been better choice of words... but then again. You chose it... =[
 @imnotaweebyounormie547  Haha... yeah
I'm Not A Weeb You Normie ok
That's the whole reason they put him there so they could make it seem like mens rights is a joke and feminism is the only legitimate cause.
 Julius Songling  derrick just because you change ur user name doesnt mean we dont know its you
Taterman 02 lmao ikr
Julius Songling How did being a Jew and loving Israel get into this? Lol
"Well, the women are human. Males, not so much. Right? I mean who is expendable? 

Derrick. 

If a war happens tomorrow, they draft Derrick to fight and die, not these privileged women. If the ship hit an iceberg and starts to sink, Derrick doesn’t get in a lifeboat before any privileged woman. And If there’s a rape (like in jail) and Derrick is the victim, everyone snickers, unlike the sympathetic response for a privileged females."
Derrick is basically god
"Shivam Kumar But in choosing those three women they’re making the feminist cause seem illegitimate 🤷🏻‍♀️
(Which I believe it to be)"
Julius Songling she literally expressed how she felt and that’s what this whole episode was about.
"@trianglesheep ""Sure, Derrick"". Man, that hit like ""Ok, Boomer"""
Julius Songling her staying how she feels and her views is not her being an “angry black women”
 Julius Songling  you do know that what you said is totally uncalled for
" @TheVersipelis  I think part of the feminism fight is to get women to be chosen to go to the army and fight in wars and not just men? It's also about not worrying about the gender/sex of a person when deciding who should live or die. That's why we want to break down the centuries long patriarchal societies ways so that these things can hopefully not be recognized when considering certain things like all the ones I have mentioned, and so much more.

 Feminism is also not only about women's rights but also for men's rights in cases such as they should be recognized and properly attented to when they are raped and abused and so on. It is also about men being recognized for being able to feel emotion and not being told they shouldn't feel it because they are a man, where they are talking about fragile masculinity. Men's feelings are valid and should be recognized, which is part of feminism, as well as women rapists and abusers being held properly accountable for what they have done."
"Courtney Skye   Tell me, what’s your thoughts on the common practice (in the USA) of male genital mutilation? Feminist are outraged, that circumcision is practiced in a few places in Africa. Yet, it happens daily to hundreds, if not thousands, of boys in the USA. Do the feminist organizations you know, do they speak out against it?"
"Courtney Skye  Here’s a little experiment for you. If you have a Target in your area, go to the card section and find all the misogynistic Christmas cards of men degrading women. Hint: there are none that I saw. Now, go find the Misandrist ones of women degrading men. There’s a few, they make fun at “Three ‘Wise’ Men”... Societal norm? Patriarchy?"
" @TheVersipelis  I can not completely talk on this topic about circumcision in the USA because I live in South Africa, but I do know that in Africa a lot of these practices happen because of cultures. I also know that it happens in a lot of religions too. So I cannot speak on why it is happening if it is happening for reasons that are not religous, or for the sake of health in some circumstances, but if it is, and if it against the will and they are not of age to make the decision, then I personally disagree and am against it.

But you seem to be very concerned about male genital mutilation. Can you then tell me your thoughts on female genital mutilation?"
" @TheVersipelis  okay first, I know that there are cards (in general not just christmas) that degrade women a lot. Such as women doing all the house work while men sit back and relax. Or aiming certain cards at specific genders, stereotyping them amd so on. I cant think of all of them but if you dont see these cards, or even just things in general literally everywhere that degrade women or put them lower than men simply because of their genitalia."
"Courtney Skye  I don’t believe anyone should be cutting body parts off non-consenting adults, male or female, unless there’s a risk to that child’s health. The facts are, that this is commonly done to male babies, and no one bats an eye. If you can stomach it, YouTube shows the procedure, and it is disgusting and barbaric! In the USA, circumcision is the standard. “Millions” of male babies, less than 24 hours old, have a piece of their body cut off them, with some of the procedures, going horribly wrong. 

I’ll direct you to the movie “The Red Pill” produced by Cassie Jaye, a feminist."
" @TheVersipelis  The problem is that you are making a fallacy. You are assuming that feminist don't talking about male mutilation, but in reality whenever they talk about female mutilation they also bring up male mutilation. 


I see you cited ""The Red Pill"", but this movie has many things wrong with it, some of which are misleading information meant to fool you. I'll direct you to big Joel video on the Red Pill."
 Julius Songling  You should have just said her name bro
" Julius Songling  Her name's Alyesha. Just leave race out of it and we're cool, okay pal?"
 唐三藏  I'm also multiracial just I don't like people stating race when it isn't 100% necessary. You seem like you mean no harm by it so I'll just back off.
"it be like that sometimes Her views aren’t based on data, they’re just a couple anecdotal, emotions appeals."
"@trianglesheep Ok, Derrick"
At least I hope so...
"Shivam Kumar people who are men’s rights activists, are in actual reality, trying to put down the idea of feminism"
They’re all bad.
Cause he is that dude only on in it cause he is scared
"Thunderstorm V2.0 Frink LMFAOOOOO the ppl who made it to where only men get drafted are MEN. The ppl who created the rule for women and children to get on the life boat first are MEN. Also there are MANY cases where women tried telling their sexual assault experience and ppl victim blame them, and this is an extreme issue that is just now being talked about in recent years. You see many issues men face are created by MEN. I’m a 17 yr old teenager and I have many male friends who say they don’t like sharing emotions and how they’ve been taught that and the ppl who inflicted these physiological issues are men. The issue with the male rights group is that it feels like a counter to 3rd wave feminism. The cause is really making things more complicated, and sometimes confusing than what it has to be."
Courtney Skye I completely agree with your point saying that feminism needs to fight for both sides since I do think their mainly focusing on women. I think men don’t need to create a join a separate movement but rather join the feminist movement and make it the way it’s supposed to be. Many men(and women) see the flaws in the current feminist movement and we should fix them instead of creating an entirely new movement which obviously takes much more work and effort.
"Thunderstorm V2.0 Frink there are advocacy groups consisting of both men and women who fight for male genital mutilation. However, the reason why it doesn’t have a lot of support in general is because there isn’t a lot of mainstream media attention on the issue YET. Feminist groups don’t speak much about it however I don’t hear many men speak on the matter either. However I do think the issue will become a popular one soon since a lot of ppl are fighting against intersex babies from being mutilated and the two matters are extremely similar in subject."
How about we agree to disagree
唐三藏 ok derrick
It was the point. Whoever gathered the participants wanted to have a bad part of mra... just so people wouldnt think mra had any kind of credibility...
" @thecrabman2074  wich points are misderecting? The movie wasnt even out yet and people tried to stop its showing. The movie was a target from the beginning cause it expaused the hypocrisy of feminism abd the suppost fight for equality. Feminism can say whatever they want but if some1 even opens the mouth to speak a word about men issues they immideatly tey to stop them.... A movement that states they fight for equality but name themselfs after women and name the enemy after men. Feminism was at the start an honest movement, now it is an ideology or religion that obly wabts previlige"
" @ruiribeiro3410  Big Joels video on the movie is a good place look, but if you want an example than the story that was told in the movie about the cheating wife is completly made up, and couldn't have happened the way it was told."
" @thecrabman2074  the video was made by a person that already hated the movie before he saw it, the way he phrases everything shows he is only shitting on the movie because it goes agaisnt his ""progressive"" views, and uses background music and  a smoth voice to make peopel think he is smart and therefore right, what people like him and you miss is that mra dont claim women dont have problems, they say men also have problems, mra dont ask to stop helping women they ask for people and governments to give the same help to men, say waht you want, look arround, 99% of waht you see was built or invented by a men. The freedom you enjoy was conquered by men who died in war to achieve it. The problem with feminism is not the fight for women, but the fight agaisnt men and the constant attack in everything male. And how do you know the cheatting wife story is wrong? Even if it is the point is there, how would a men fell if he found out that the child he loved for years was not his real son or daughter? And waht are the consequences to the women who lied? We live in a society that cries everytime a women claims she had her feeling hurts but dismisses anyu pain men might feel."
 唐三藏  She was literally asked to speak her experiences.
I'm Not A Weeb You Normie Do you know about jokes?
i wanna join the feminest team just to not be on the same side as derrick
唐三藏 be’s racist
Yea they got an extreme for the mens side but not the womens? Seems a bit biased and fishy
Even the girls were the ones who felt compelled to set them apart: 'i feel like each of you are coming from different places' and the guys   emphatically nodded..
Derrick and Zach were the best. IT was the toxic feminists that were so hard to listen to.
" @maggiewhiteside4463  then you werent actually listening 😒 

I bet the one with the long braides speaking of the abuse she endured from sexually entitled men was 'hard to listen to'..  

Plus the only guy who made the most sense was the one sitting closest to the front.."
"The Soliloquist yes, she was extremely angry and needs to see a therapist"
"The Soliloquist A comment war! I have never passed on a good comment war. Your experience tells you to agree with her, my experience tells me not to. 
She tells no stats, only experience. I could watch it again and “listen” to her points but Please, don’t make me watch it again! It was hard enough to get through it once. Toxic feminism gives me anxiety! I love my man and have mucho respect to most men I know. I am grateful that men are strong and women are caring. I love how we are made different and I embrace my femininity. I can love myself and love men. No need to hate. Got to forgive those who have hurt you and move on. I think these women need to do some soul searching, perhaps you as well, if there is a group of people that anger you, forgive them, move on, and don’t place blame where it doesn’t belong"
" @maggiewhiteside4463  lol.. you are going to criticize her for the arbitrariness of the pure 'heresay' you allege on her part (as to even lean towards the presumption of complete fabrication).. but 'YOUR' past experiences being muddled into you passing judgement on a perfect stranger and the integrity of her word, now 'thats' something of 'credibility' lol.. 

what you are using is called bias.. which has no place in objective reasoning.. 

Just curious.. how could she prove to you she was being truthful in that moment?"
"The Soliloquist I think if she told the whole story, it would be interesting. Ok, this comment war is boring now. You won! Good job."
word!
Taterman 02 “and let me chime in with my opinion on that”
At least the incel had the insight to point out he was more conservative and speak for himself rather than everyone.
I don’t honk that’s why jubilee put Derrick there. I don’t think this was suppose to be a fair debate.
Derrick is the grey area in this conversation😄
"Round of applause for single mothers who raise boys...
Clap clap clap"
Actually Derrick is pretty straightforward but not organised in his dialogues. He doesnt know to talk diplomatically and similarly Mimi and the other Feminist had egocentric views
" @maggiewhiteside4463  thank u for pointing out the fact that these womens behavior was absolutely abhorrent. Everyone jumps on Derrick, but all the females were throwing hissy fits and DEMANDING and even ridiculing the MRAs for not agreeing with them"
 唐三藏  isnotreal??
"唐三藏 ‘angry black woman’ I think you’re letting your prejudice color your vision. You’re not colorblind. What I saw was a woman, yes being a bit sensitive, but because she was talking about a vulnerable subject. I saw her starting to spiral, but I didn’t see anger"
 @courtneyskye4925  i keep saying this. You are 100% correct
 @chakdefiji  they dont need Derrick for that. Lol
 @TheVersipelis  actually there are women/feminists who speak out against male circumcision. Its s growing trend in the US not to circumcise boys.
" @TheVersipelis  there are also cards that put women in stereotypes.
I went to by a card for my BFFs bday, amd I couldnt find one where is wasnt about going shopping, getting drunk on wine, or getting manicures at the spa. 
As a women, both me and my BFF dont do any of those things."
" @jeffhudson831  👏👏👏
 well said! You are very concise and articulate for someome who is only 17. You are a credit to your generation."
honestly!! they both seemed extremely willing to listen and be just ruined it 😭
They all had terrible arguments anyway tbh
​ @TheVersipelis lol
Derrick is my father figure
Erin : tHat’S nOt vEgAn
"This is hard to comment on because I think many people have seen women act childish and it’s more socially acceptable because society has in the last 100 of years treated women as a commodity to be locked away, wed off to produce kids and stay at home without as much responsibility as men who overall had to protect family from threats, deal with decision making, providing income. This is controversial statement and it is definitely seen with some women who don’t want to take responsibility and grow up but it’s also a problem society has created and some people want to protect this traditional outlook but then complain about it later. Now we’re in a time period where women don’t need protection, can have equal education opportunities and can work and do jobs that men mainly dealt with and it’s amazing and a lot more easier for both sexes to deal with tackle together. I hope people can understand that and hopefully Derrick if he’s looking through these comments."
Cheeze berries I do agree. If you need the whole world to clear the way an change for you to be comfortable then you have a little bit in common with a child.
" @DeeznutztheOG  same here, some people just act like we're not men enough and im very sure you mustve heard that saying too, i dont think its generally targetted against a specific gender though more or less just childish people acting childish"
INVADE derrick: women=child? Yes?
men and women aren't equals that's biology
 Bon Jovi  feminists disagree
@Simone Volman  so feminism search for equality turning man into woman and woman into man??
" Bon Jovi  sorry for my english,  I don't speak so well yet"
Jajajajajajjajaja
Ezzy n. Did you watch the video?
Ezzy n. Ooohhhh sorry lol
" @DeeznutztheOG  Um, except you are wrong. How do women not need protection when they (or at least: feminists) are constantly whining about feeling unsafe at night, for instance?
And male-dominated fields are still male-dominated. Some even in 90+%. Women could do a male job for a few decades now, I'm pretty sure, yet the toxic feminism has exploded just recently."
Gabriel where’s the stats.
 @DeeznutztheOG  no woman are in just as much danger as before and unless they're Ronda Rousey they need a man to protect thrm because the avarage man is alot sttonger than woman
"turbotrup96 you would agree that mechanic is a male dominated job, correct? There is very often the problem that if women want to do this job, they don’t get a chance, no place to work at because men think that women aren‘t strong enough. And if men want to become a nursery school teacher they are often told that this isn‘t a manly job anf they should do something else or Parents don’t want a male nursery teacher because they think that he is going to assault their children. Both is sexism and both is not ok. But you can’t say that male and female dominated jobs still exist because the opposite gender don‘t want to do those jobs they often don’t get any chance and get judged. Oh and about the part of feeling unsafe at night as an argument that women need to be protected. Y‘all don‘t realize that we feel unsafe because of men? That y‘all talking about that we need to be protected from Men? If we would teach Boys and Men that they shouldn’t harras/assault/rape etc. Women there would be no need for us to be protected by Men from Men."
"Derrick was saying that we have a different set of rules for lots of differences, such as age, so maybe there should be some for sexes. That's what I got out of it, at least. I hate Derrick too, but if he does have a point on that, I still wanna hear it"
tRUE HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
" @janao5017  I almost agreed with you but then you said word men.
mostly that how we think but better wording could be ""bad people"" as there might be afraid from both men or women.
violence is not exclusive to males and both gender can be equally nasty.
you tried to give generalization of typical human stereotypical mindset but fall for own cause."
 @dragonsquirrel7663  why..??
"Black White the guy I answered to, made fun of women that feel unsafe at night but saying that they don’t need men to protect them. I don’t know about you but I as a woman am more afraid of men than women. Ofcourse are there women that rape, assault etc but they are way less than men (it’s still a problem tho). I just refered to only men in my comment to make a point that this person I answered to, would maybe understand that the reason why we need to be protected by men from men is because some men think that they are superior and can do whatever the fuck they want. I never said that this doesn’t happen the other way around. But I stated the more common way to make a point."
Literally
A child? nO!
He is right legally speaking.
 @DemonsCrest1  never have children please
"​ @marsh1348  

never have children please

what made you say that? me pointing out the fact that women are not equal to men? or me pointing out the fact that children raised by single parent mothers have terrible life outcomes? sorry if me saying that men are important to society and important for raising healthy children offended you :o"
"What Derrick meant, was that there are laws governed towards children; same as there are laws governed towards both genders. This is not to their detriment but rather it is catered towards their strengths and works to balances out the weaknesses and differences between them."
 @DeeznutztheOG  lmao in my opinion a lot of woman dont know how to fight and need protection tf they gonna do slap a guy wit a gun or a drunk guy thats gonna fight her
Yes there is indeed a neurological difference between men and women. It is quite clear in this video with Derrick’s behavior.
"​@pomegranate juice 

but this has nothing to do with gender, really.

That is an opinion. 90% of single parent homes are single parent mother homes (again thanks to feminist laws). So whenever any discussion about single parents is taking place, that is mostly a discussion about single parent mothers.

I find it amusing how feminists have no problem saying that it is mostly men who are in prison (that most criminals are men, and that those men are bad). But when you reverse the genders and say something that is about women (e.g. that most single parents are women, and that their children have worse life outcomes) then this suddenly becomes a problem.

it has to do with how good the parenting is. a lot of times, the single mother/father is working from sun up to sun down in order to provide their child with basic necessities, so they don't have all the time in the world to teach their child. yes, i agree that it would be better to have two parents in the picture, but sometimes that's just not possible, which a lot of people who think like you seem to not accept as an answer.

Or maybe it has to do with the fact that fathers and mother are different and that both parenting styles have an equally important role in a child's development. Maybe it is important for there to be ""gender diversity"" in parenting, and maybe it is important for families to hear the ""male perspective"" (or ""father's perspective"") on things rather than supporting the ""outdated and sexist stereotype"" that the home and the raising of children is strictly the woman's domain :/"
"​@pomegranate juice 

the point i was making was that both fathers and mothers are important when raising children.

also, pointing out individual cases of children being raised by gay parents and turning out great does not prove anything (similar to how pointing out cases of children being raised by single mothers turning out great).  I agree that like children raised by single parents, most children raised by gay parents will probably turn out fine as well. but I would not be surprised if by analyzing the rates of bad outcomes (e.g. suicide, drug overdose, emotional problems, etc) there was found to be a difference between gay parents and hetero parents as well."
"I believe the reason why he brought up children wasn't to compare women to children in a deameaning way, but rather to point out the fact that we have different laws for women, similarly to how we have different laws for children, because the laws are built to PROTECT the women and children under the laws. That's literally what he said before he even said the word child, but a lot of people latched onto that and the girls definitely latched onto that and took offense as an emotional response rather than thinking about what he said logically. Of course i don't agree with everything he said, similarly to how I don't agree with everything the women have said, but I can understand what he meant to portray"
"​ @Kiakyu  

Yep. women want the responsibility of children but the rights/authority of adults.

Women: ""Why don't men see us as their equals?""
Also Women: ""The government should give us special legal rights. it should also give us men's money and give us men's jobs. and if I accidentally get pregnant and decide to keep it, the man should be financially responsible for my decision. and if i have sex with a drunk man and am drunk myself, that should be seen rape. and if i get a job and don't feel like coming into work I shouldn't have to do it. and if a job is too difficult for me, the standards should be lowered so that I can do it. and i should always get my way and get everything I want by complaining"""
 @DemonsCrest1  I couldn't have said it better myself 👏
luvthyself -  TRUCK HONK
woman: (exists) Derrick: (cue vine noise) 😮 a CHILD
Derrick literally acted like a child throughout this entire video I am not kidding.
 @Pizola  HOW ARE WOMAN LEGALLY CHILDREN?
 @Roan.bot.  ITS NOT CHILDISH TO WANT EQUAL RIGHTS! It’s childish to think that you are superior based on the gender you are.
 @UberAl2008  what’s wrong is being called childish for wanting to be treated equally
 @Pizola  how so? Calling all women childish is hypocritical considering it’s pretty childish to think you are superior just because you were born male
" @laylawalker116  bad people exist and will always exist.

Hmmmm child lolololol
 @vanilsting10  who said that🤡
 @nf6075  what
" @turbotrup96  There are still barriers in place for women even if women are now legally allowed to enter any job in the workforce. Often men turn women away who are trying to get into the industry because they believe women aren't equipped for the job even if they have the same qualifications as another male candidate. It's going to take a long time before women are fully welcomed into male-dominated fields. A lot more women are going to college and pursuing degrees, which will hopefully help close the gap."
" @DemonsCrest1  I can't speak for all women, maybe some women have this mentality, but as a feminist myself, I just want equal opportunities in the workforce and to receive justice after I've been assaulted. Your comment is the definition of misogyny. Why do you have so much contempt for women? Who hurt you and why are you using that experience to justify putting down an entire group of people?"
" @tracer4322  You believe there will be that many construction workers, for instance?"
Not on derrick’s side but wasn’t it just an example of adults and children not women and children
"He was just using children as an example. Like women, children are treated differently in the eyes of the law."
 @Acore-ly9qx  if y'all do not harm us why do we need to be protected?
 @DemonsCrest1  well I had a single mom and guess what me and my brother both are very healthy and more happier 🥱
 @DemonsCrest1  but what if my mom was gay
" @DemonsCrest1  yk what I respect every human rights and I don't identify myself as feminist, and yeah maybe ur right but ur wording was offensive"
 @DemonsCrest1  but how did we get from the comment to this parenting thingy lmaoooo
At least children have potential
The women feminists didn't want to learn!!!
him and kursat
" @CristanioPeweyyy  yeah it seemed so, they just want the other side to understand them."
"Yeah he was carrying the whole show tbh, and he has a gf so i guess thats why he was trying to understand womans views. SInce Derrick said its so difficult to find a partner, not surprised that it is hard for him."
​ @CristanioPeweyyy  tbvh I don't think they'd react that way either if they didn't invite incel in the room lmao
 @nasrinnski  Not an excuse!!
 @CristanioPeweyyy  you seem emotional
​ @CristanioPeweyyy Reverse sexism.
" @CristanioPeweyyy i don’t want to agree with this, but i have to, they really seemed like they wanted to fight for their side, not like this is bad, but definitely not the best thing to do"
"@CristanioPeweyyy

you seem sad . Wanna cookie ?"
 @zeneer-6987  ur 4 months late bro
 @Demib34 yeah I kinda wished they chosen women who were more well-spoken and not so quick to be interrogative and harsh. Not the best representation imo but still accurate of how many women feel… (that’s not me saying I agree or it justifies anything)
"that's not true, the women are talking to the other guys too. you actually don't have to think too hard on why men look for any reason to try to bring down women over nothing :/"
Ight imma like

And 🤬
And me 😂🖕
More like: 🙄
"havent watched the video all the way im gonna guess derrick is the kid with the yellow jacket and the ugly haircut

update: i was right 🤑🤌"
that man has no idea what he’s saying
i- ok
Sorry but it literraly felt like derrick was joking..
I love how this comment how no dislikes
It’s because he said he was a YouTuber and incel
man.. what makes you think that I need to be protected by you. I should be protected from you
i am everyone
Even the guys sometimes....
For real
"Derrick: ofcourse finding a girl is hard.

Internally: don’t you think because you’re like that?"
I don't think derrick feels empathy at all.
LOL that I’m PERIOD
"Derrick was a prick, he wasn’t a men’s rights activist he just didn’t want women to have any power"
 @jazzallen4226  yeah still doesn’t make him look any better that outfit was NOT helping him either 😆🙈 BHAHAHAHA HE SUCH A BUM 🙈😆
😂
 @nate7418  nah men derick is the gold
He knows what he talking about
exactly I don’t like him at all-
So true
Facts bro. Derrick kind of let the mens activist down
The sheep mentality of these comments are real!! You people can’t even give points on why you feel the way you do about him😒🐑
"Me looking at the comments before watching the video
""I;m sure he can't be that bad""
Me finishing the video 
""😐"""
"Can you be genuine pls? He literally said 'getting married, having kids, going to church'. Which of those do you have a problem with?

Seems to me like you just arbitrarily decide what you think he is saying without actually listening to any of the words.

What he said:

""Back to the past where people were getting married, having kids, going to church""

What you heard:

""Back to the past where women couldnt vote or hold bank accounts"""
" @suntzu6122  pluuueeeeaase 🙄 The dude just wants women to follow his lead and do what he says. When they were complacent, only housewives, cooking and taking care of children. You’re the one choosing not to see certain realities behind his comments, even his demeanor."
" @JorQuin   complacent*. wtf is complaisant, is this what feminism is teaching you hahaha"
" @migwigpee0796  Lol big insults coming from someone who is straight wrong.

" @suntzu6122  So you're above 15 years and can't read betwen the lines? What could Derrick possible mean with ""Back to the past where people were getting married, having kids, going to church"" when in fact most people still do this very things in the present? That's obviously not what he is remanincing about the past. What Derrick did with that phrase is called dog whistle, he used coded langagues to make inflamable ideas sound innocuous to some people, but still sending a hidden derogatory message to the knowing ear."
 @Luuhpan genuinely thank you for helping me discover the term dog whistle
 @Luuhpan  What a load of crap. A hidden message? How do you know what the message is? It's just your speculation based on nothing.
 @user-sonosada he’s a incel why is it so hard for him to do that now it wasn’t the case. He literally said I’m very traditional..
 @The.rapist911  bro that handle and dylan pfp🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
And no one likes Derrick
No this is Patrick
"Ah yes, the three genders"
Fr😭
Why does everyone hate Derek
A humanist potato is mayonnaise an instrument
🤣oh man
Derrick is a different breed to us
Rick Mannion what’s an incel
" @Dog15308 ""involuntary celibates"", also known as incel, are members of an online subculture who define themselves as unable to find a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one."
He’s so annoying
DSFEU INCEL
🤣😭 glad we all agreed
He's an youtuber what were u expecting? Lmao xD
 @kazumasato5226  wtf is wrong with him getting a definition from the internet
Wombiwoo I do
 @stoopidgoober  so 90% of the internet gotcha
Derrick is also completely right but hes way to awkward to get his point accros most people dont study biology so they wont really know what the differences are between a man and a woman i bet derrick has a lot more understanding if how a woman works then those feminists combined
 @wesleydamen2018  ...Women dont know ...women? So...men know women? I'm sorry sir but what the hell.
no problem with him
 @ambie7437  as in how a body works how many people do you know that know how the human body works he is a biologist someone who studies the human body so yes this men knows more about a female body then the average female
" @wesleydamen2018  
But why would you base society on biology. Shouldn't we be talking about psychology?"
Homeboy is literally an incel....no
 @wesleydamen2018  why do you bring biology in a talk about society
 @denalv3070  if you dont see how our biology impacts our society you better leave the converstaion mate
It seems like derrick just doesn't care
 @kaledoublescope  imagine being his girlfriend
"It’s funny because they had a toxic man, 2 good men, and some very angry woman. (I am a female) So like..."
DERRICK WAS SOMETHING ELSE OMFG BRO
Haha
Thanks I think people might’ve needed that to understand that.
Ay Derrick wasn’t wrong tho
 @thehogcog553  Did you even watch the vid?
"Honestly Mimi was just as bad as him. And I'm a girl and mostly agreed with what Derrick said, even though his approach I guess was not it"
Wtf was he thinking
"Why does everyone hate Derrick




Cuz we just do"
" @wesleydamen2018  whatt????? Are you female? Or are you just bias??? Cause the fact that you just said that the femanist side, who are female if I may add... dont know anything about how women act, its as if your saying that they dont know themselfs or who their representing."
" @melkab4765 , not trying to pick a fight... but at first I was like its not like his lying, until he brought up the kids one at that point my ""its not like"" was thrown out the window and replaced by hatred."
" @pandadog4990  I understand that. There were parts were he made me kinda angry too because his points were not coming out in the right way and it was bugging me a bit. But it's up to us to ""hate"" him or not but we should maybe dislike his beliefs or the way he was saying them rather than the person being."
DSFEU Derek is sexist. Don’t be like Derek kids
Wombiwoo I kinda liked Derricks hoodie
Tell me about it! 😒
" @evilhagwannabe1820  I hate derrick, all of my homies hate derrick."
Wombiwoo b-But my name is Derrick * sad noises *
AKA incels
 @wesleydamen2018  Sooo... sociology?
Derek makes my brain hurt he make some wanna die half of the time he speaks
"Wesley Damen u mean to say that biologically, women are comparable to children.  Or what?  Lmao"
Yup
 @avaturner1665  NO THIS IS PATRICK!!!
 @ambie7437  so there's a way of how women work like not all women are the same and they don't work the same.
 @dyingrat2439  be like john
"Amal Akram lmao yes, he calmly explained he was stabbed and the girl was like “I was VIOLATED! I was in SHOCK! She said I was gonna cry” starts crying"
There's a Derrick in every country
I feel like men activist is more to retain all we have and let women has access to it too.. Nowadays being a man devalues evrything you do
And yea Dertuck is crazy.. He is a patriarchal conservative activist
He low-key looks scary
Derrick is a whole other human species
 @elstonngunn4193  it could be
" @stoopidgoober  that term pisses me off because ""involuntary"" suggests that they think it's someone else's fault that they're a virgin. Like, look at yourself before expecting certain things from other people ffs. Excuse my rant."
 @wesleydamen2018  Derrick wants to go back to a time when women were expected to be housewives because he thinks that would make them happy. And you think he understands women? REALLY?
 @wesleydamen2018  both sides acknowledged the physical differences between the two genders already so it's not really a point of debate.
 @ethanbutler7866  yes on the obvious diffremces but they dont even know what makes them diffrent is what i meant
 @wesleydamen2018  what specifically are we talking about here? so I can answer your point accurately
 @evilhagwannabe1820  wtf.. You are true feminist 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
He just built different 💪😡
And blue haired Karen!
Lol
Am I the only guy that like Derrick?!
 @stoopidgoober  So I'm a incel
"Hey! Derrick brought up some very good points about evolutionary biology being a factor, traditional ways of life vs modern life among other things. You guys out there just dismiss him because he is an incel?

Incels are a creation of how screwed the system made them. They are lost souls in this current system. It's really sad if anything. I think his point of view was crucial to the issues men face even if you disagree. We should be trying to reverse that tragedy if anything not throwing fire on his parade and making it worse."
😂
Real men don’t rape o shy must a been John cena
HAHAHAHAH
DSFEU boys why would you like Derek?? Just give me one reason.
"There red pill men, beta men then there is Youseff"
"True my dude, he kinda sucked"
I think they added an extra err in his name.
True
I keep seeing hate comments on Derrick but no one will give an example on why Derrick is sexist
Lightning Shrek he just says stuff like how he thinks men are greater than females
Damn everyone hate Derrick lmao
"DSFEU boys, Did u hear what he said? Derek is the definition of toxic masculinity"
Men's rights where poorly represented here
DSFEU boys why do you not hate derrek?
 @evilhagwannabe1820  no
"Derrick is the by-product of feminism 
Soon the world will be full of Derricks 
Thanks to feminism"
LOL
Derrick is the middle ground
"Derick, a male activist"
Youssef Kassm bruh these no such this called male activists there only there because they disagree with woman and want women forever to stay behind males 😌👍🏾
Lol 😂
" @gabi-jl7le  not all girls are feminine, and not all men are men's right activists"
 Sassy Queen  yay
and we dont like derrick
 @Dog15308  you’re a kid aren’t you
 @As3nOne  what did I say I can’t find my comment
 @As3nOne  oh did I ask what’s an incel? Is that it? How does that imply I’m a kid well i mean I guess ppl consider my age a kid but the reason I don’t know what that is is cause I’m not much of a social media guy so I never learn these new words for example I still don’t know what a simp is and there was this word ratchet? Idk there’s a bunch I still don’t know if you really wanna know my age is 19
 @evilhagwannabe1820  everyone loves Derrick lol
 @gilgameshendotensei3254  Derrick just seems like he has this attitude for a persona he uses to get attention. lol
 @masunrise7471  yup hes like leland townsand
 @elstonngunn4193  so because he can’t find a place for himself in society you hate him?
i mean he admitted to being an incel lmao
"Dude if you thought this was bad watch his meet an incel video, like wtf 😂"
How... Derrick
 @ahumanistpotato0501  bahahah
i liked derrick the most
He gives me chills
 @lidelle_owo5609  you’re fine. He ain’t
I’m both and I hate Derrick.
"Ohhh boy, he’s a whole another story"
"Most MRA and feminists fights for equality and MRA just want men problems to get solved too, along with the women problems. 
There are many feminist too who are misandrists and just want men hating and ignores men problems and mra are just against them.
Tag does not matter. 
We should help both genders instead of fighting that who is better or who suffers more, we should for equality and HELP all genders. 
I am true feminist and true mra."
Yup ive seen a video where its him being an incel and thats the main topic
"Valid point, but he is technically a mens right activist in his own way. I think he is more traditional, and even though there is nothing wrong with that, he was one of the more aggressive, yet messy, speakers. I didn't agree with a lot he said, if any, but I do think it was insightful for him to have been there."
" @elstonngunn4193  I don't think that is a good reason. Not every incel is a bad person. Derrick was just unlikable. Not because of him being an incel, but because, in my opinion, he was messy in his presentation of ideas, and he was more aggressive than he needed to be."
" @imizzy7585  
Everybody hates incels, even incels hate incels."
Derick is just a male version of feminists on twitter
" @lots_of_bendy_straws  
Do they all walk into a bar?"
 @mridlon1634  yes.
I think he was there to create argument to maybe create a “different” perspective and to “shake” things up.
 @gabi-jl7le  😂😂
"oh don't worry, you won't neet to encourage people to diss Derrick, people are already very willing to do it"
You should encourage dissing derrick he deserves it
No you should courage people to diss Derrick smh
 @wesleydamen2018  even so he decided it was appropriate to use this information to invalidate women at the end he isn’t looking for progression he specifically wants to go back where men was “superior” within society
" @ethanbutler7866  ""Derrick wants to go back to a time when women were expected to be housewives because he thinks that would make them happy. And you think he understands women? REALLY?""

If we look at the progress of women's rights and compare that with their self reported levels of happiness it becomes quite obvious that there is an inverse correlation between the two. I understand correlation does not imply causation so there might be other reasons for why this is happening but it's really not an insane position by any stretch of the imagination.

Also Im going to say something that I believe should be obvious but apparently it isn't. Women are an incredibly large group of people so being a woman actually is pretty insignificant when it comes to understanding the entire concept of women.

Just because you have a brain doesn't mean you studied how brains work which is why when you have problems with your brain you go to an expert on brains and that expert helps you fix the problem. The same is true for women...just because you are a woman doesn't mean you understand the large scale implications of being a woman vs being a man. It's just like the brain...in order to really understand it you need to study it and both men and women are equally capable of doing that."
" @DIVAD291  well obviously it's impossible to understand women as a whole because They're all different, I'm not disputing that but Derrick is acting like going back to a patriarchal society will make ALL women happy. Presumably he thinks that because before the women's right movement women weren't protesting that they were happy in that situation, which may be the case for some women at the time but that's probably mainly because they'd never experienced anything else. Derrick has a very simplistic and childlike, idealistic view of the past and frankly I have no idea where he's got that from.

If he wants to live like that within his own personal setting and his future family are ok with that then fine, you do you but to assume that it will be that way for everyone is ignorant. 
The mention of him understanding women was, I believe a reply to someone who suggested Derrick has a good understanding of women and what they ""want"" but you just have to look at the responses from women in the comments to see the exact opposite at least for the majority. 

Above all Derrick shouldn't have even been in this video because he's not a men's rights activist he's a traditionalist and a self proclaimed incel. My main problem with him is that he was preventing the two sides from reaching some kind of understanding"
"To sabotage it and make the men look wrong, obviously."
" @ethanbutler7866  ""well obviously it's impossible to understand women as a whole because They're all different""
That wasn't my point. My point was specifically that large scale systems aren't understood by being a part of them but rather by studying them and my example of this was how someone that studied psychology is likely going to have a better understanding of how YOUR brain works than you do and that effect is going to matter more and more as you increase the scale of what you are looking at.

""Derrick is acting like going back to a patriarchal society will make ALL women happy.""
Pretty much any solution to a large scale problem will not be able to make all of any group happy so if that's what he believes he's going to be wrong but I think you are unfair in your assessment that that's what is really being discussed here.

""before the women's right movement women weren't protesting that they were happy in that situation, which may be the case for some women at the time but that's probably mainly because they'd never experienced anything else.""
The relative happiness of women has gone down as the feminist movement made the most progress so I don't think it's because they hadn't experienced it because they have and it didn't make them happier.

""Derrick has a very simplistic and childlike, idealistic view of the past ""
I agree and disagree at the same time. I think the difference between Derrick and feminists is that he views certain things as positive and they view certain things as negative. They both have simplistic and childlike views of the past.

""but you just have to look at the responses from women in the comments to see the exact opposite at least for the majority. ""
No looking at what women believe about themselves will only tell you what women believe about themselves and there is no guarantee that that will match with reality. Also we are on a left leaning channel and feminism is a common ideology on the left so it makes perfect sense that you would get a lot of women that believe in feminism and therefore disagree with Derrick so there's a decent bit of selection bias on top.

We can also expand your logic to feminism. A lot of feminists tell men that feminism will help them but a lot of men disagree with that position...is that proof that feminism will not help men? Not really, it just tells us that men don't agree but it's entirely possible that men are wrong about themselves and feminism is right about them.

""Above all Derrick shouldn't have even been in this video because he's not a men's rights activist he's a traditionalist and a self proclaimed incel.""
I mean personally Im not sure any of the people they picked for that video should have been in this video. We can discuss whether the guy that had a little bit of research belonged there but everyone else was pathetic and had basically 0 depth to their position and did nothing constructive.

Also I don't really understand the whole thing about caring more about people coming to an understanding than figuring out truth. I mean sure from an evolutionary perspective being rejected by the group is basically a death sentence so you want people to come to an understanding for the sake of safety but given how far we have come we should at the very least be trying to move past that instead of glorifying this outdated survival instinct."
Nah let's hard diss derrick
"I found the black one disturbing. The brown one was slightly less disturbing. The slanted eye yellow one, a little less disturbing yet. The three white ones were alright. There's my opinion on this video.😁✌"
 @lots_of_bendy_straws  personally I think some of the women had good points and they were mature about it I really think if Derrick wasn’t there it could of been a far more civil conversation
Probably to start conversation. When there is a guy who is just an unknowing and old school thinker like him. People will most likely start a conversation because of what he says
true but derrick was stating the facts tho
 @eana_p376  If he can get one lmao
They probably included derrick for some added conflict. Two groups of activists with similar goals would be less interesting in the eyes of viewership
"Maybe thats why they had him, too see a way too far end of the espectrum"
What is an incel
 @eana_p376  on what planet would anyone and I mean anyone choose him for a boyfriend.
 @haiiiyall5465 💀
 @thehogcog553  because he's entitled
derek definitely doss not have any friend irl
He basically in talking about traditional values was saying men should be superior and he had to catch himself when they were talking about empathy 💀💀💀
" @rachsmith3479  well maybe not straight up hating men but at least 2 completely dismiss male issues, i mean Alyesha didn’t give a crap when Zach said why he was a men’s rights activist and just said “by other men” as if that was enough to convince him to not be an activist or to not fight for men’s rights"
 @kroix4105  I think it was just your confirmation bias tbh.
" @rachsmith3479  then as soon as he said how and why, she said something completely irrelevant to what they were talking about and acting as if they dismissed their issues but all Zach did was talk about men’s issues and she instantly switched it back to women’s issues"
" @kroix4105  Also, didn't these men kept asking to prove the validity of the experiences of most women? Since they didn't want to believe in it, you think they kept switching to women's issues? 🥴"
 @rachsmith3479  they are supposed to be talking about rights not privileges. U should hav a right to see your kids and to hav a fair trial and personal experiences like the ones Alyesha talked about don’t do much other than grow sympathy. U can’t change bad people and u can’t change all people so u will always hav bad people. Its just the way it is
HEJAJJEJEJEJJEJE
" @kroix4105  Excuse me? Seeking respect as a human being, safety as a human being is privilege? 😲"
 @kroix4105  bye!
" @rachsmith3479  sadly yes, not all people get respect and there is no way to guarantee that so it is inconsistent and therefore u cannot fight for it really. U really gna try and fight for a law that well forces someone to speak a certain way. 🤨🤨🤨 sounds like it violates the 1st Amendment. U can’t completely control crime and that is fact so no point in trying to fight for it lmaooo 😂😂"
" @kroix4105  Oh really? Asking people to be respectful to another human being is violation of law?? 😒😑😑 
I go to law school random stranger, I may not know everything yet, but I do know it's not violation of any rights to ask them to respect someone. Right to dignified life remember? 😑😑🤦"
" @rachsmith3479  i never said it was a violation to ask, i said it was a violation to force. Wowwww ur so smart that u put words in other people’s mouthsss woahhhh😱😱😱"
" @kroix4105  Violation to force? What does that even mean? 🤣🤣 Wow, YOU are soooo smart. Really. 🤦🤦😒"
"Derrick is sad because he cannot get women, like why is he so rude by laughing all the time"
FACTS
 @wesleydamen2018  well I think that you don't know what you are talking about
 @wesleydamen2018  who talked abt bodies ? This literally doesn't have anything to do w the subject
​ @wesleydamen2018  boy u're the one who better leave ur whole pov is honestly unnecessary.
 @lots_of_bendy_straws  they weren't angry...
Wesely Damon I study human psychology and biology. Nothing he said was true.
"Mel Kab I hope you know that’s just ur opinion tho, cause alot of what he said was factually wrong."
Derrick solos.
 @gabi-jl7le  funny😐
 @ahumanistpotato0501  hilarious 😐
 @thehogcog553  Bc he is the worst kind of person you can be
Right like he took the term male activist and completely mixed it with sexism
 @ahumanistpotato0501  Can you teach me Wumbology?
LMAO
Laterally lmaoo
Someone already said this
" @wesleydamen2018  he's been on something else. He's mad women won't give him a chance, wants to be more traditional, BUT doesn't have a job. .... he wants to be a provider for a wife who doesn't work, BUT he doesn't have a job? Yeah, nah."
ironically hes called chad now in the incel wiki
 @thehogcog553  You'll see...
 @gabi-jl7le  LMAO
" @notgayatall5454  wtf? Psychology comes from our brain, our brain is the main reason we function like that, men and women have different brains, so all of that is biology, so in the end , even if we said we are equal, we are different from a lot, ""equal"" should always refer to opportunities not us and not gender roles like father and mother"
"Derrick... he appears from this same channel title 
"" i am an incel, ask me anything""
Look it up!"
 @sparcx86channel42  there is
Agreed
I am derrick 🗿
You can't even spell women without men
embarrassment
"why they invite Derrick, easily replaceable"
derrick a menace 😂
Don't be Derrick.
 @notgayatall5454  why would biology not be considered when factoring society?
he makes me laugh
"Incel came from Invcel which was a term created by a woman actually in the late 1990s, who wanted to create an online support group for those who saw themselves as invcels or involuntary celibate, people who couldn't get a relationship due to being love shy, socially awkward, low self esteem or confidence, or due to mental or physical illness or disability. That's what it meant originally. I relate to the first definition due to having ASD, as well as several mental illnesses and disability. It has since been more redefined as ""entitled white het cis males, sometimes beta-males, also sometimes considered racist, sexist,"" and basically is used as a pejorative, even though I admit have seen traits of the second definition with myself at times in the past, but I am trying to be more understanding and open to new experiences, and I would also consider myself agreeing with radical and classical feminism, as well as a mens rights activist."
 @thehogcog553 he's annoying and naive
 @thehogcog553  my question
 @kaledoublescope  annoyingly correct
 @ambie7437  some of what he said is true
 @yejiitzxore7883  cool
 @eana_p376  lucky woman
 @dyingrat2439  how?
 @yyakobuu  bro has max swag
 @ethanbutler7866  L ethan
 @northstar5213  I’m with you bro Derrick was speaking nothing but facts
 @cheddarking8425  damn bro you got the whole squad laughing..
 @aliceopex  false
 @ellzzzzzzzzzzzz2191  because he made some actual points
 @spidercrumple69420  you give zero two a bad name
 @sicjunior  how
 @aliceopex  he was being factual she was not 🤷‍♂
 @sicjunior  do u know what the OG comment was
 @kaledoublescope  🤷‍♂
 @sicjunior  darn it’s alr
 @gabi-jl7le 😭
Jeanne Ouellet that’s why i’m pro choice
AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA I ALMOST CHOKED ON MY SALIVA
It is my right to not have that kid...
Like how you called the kid an it
That would be a bad dream to never wake up from.
Stop that abort that
Not to mention raising that creature by yourself...
This is a valid reason why abortion should be legal.
I wish my kid was as realistic as him
I’d be proud
 @scoopersketchy3365  You shouldn't be.
 @kennedyu2953  same ✌👁👄👁
"Honestly if that every happens, I'm disowning them. The fact that they would think that about me who would die for them and for the future step daughter I'd have. Hell no. My door is closed"
The one time I would support abortion 💀
Kennedy Ü LMAOOO GO OFFF
"Imagine having a kid and it calls herself a ""feminist""."
Well if your kid grows up to be as hurt as him it is a failure on your part and you have no one to blame but you.
@Limestuuu GGG Well then don't discriminate against men. Stop believing you're a poor victim.
 @sitalvs  yeah they need to grow up
 @sitalvs ok priveledged
 @sitalvs  where is that? I am obviously talking about the west.
 @sitalvs  yeah but the video is about the west. There are certainly places where women are disadvantaged but certainly not in the west and that's where these extremist femis come from.
Lamooo
 @kennedyu2953  hahahah
"   Educate yourself, please. I'm not even a woman and I support feminism. You guys getting so offended by it is just the prove of toxic masculinity."
" @wanderer5125  Ok? Im a human and support equality. You are very clearly completely uninformed, it's sad. By how many metrics need men to fare worse then women till you question your women are the ultimate victim believes? Well you don't know any anyways since you never informed yourself. 
No intelligent person of any gender calls themselves feminist in 2021 in the west."
"   why do you always bring up the west lol. It's not the entire world you know? And I'm not even from the west. And what point of feminism is against equality? If feminism oppressed male I wouldn't support them, my dude. YOU are the one that never informed yourself. I've witnessed the double standard by my own eyes. Some of my friends got beaten by their family because they wanted a son. Some of them can't study or get a job on a topic that they wanted because they aren't male. And some even got sexually abused. Of course I support human equality, why else would I support feminist?   Yes, men's rights matter and WOMAN'S TOO. The point of feminism is to achieve equality for both male and female, because now there aren't.

Just imagine that your house is on fire. The fire fighters came and rushed to your house. And your neighbors are like ""What about my house? My house matters too!!"". You'd be like ""Well,yes but mine is on FIRE!!""."
 @wanderer5125  I bring the west up because that's where I have been my whole life. Obviously.
"some states are drop off states
you just drop them off and they become a ward of the state."
Imagine having a feminist person who’s ur daughter also🤦‍♂️
 @jayheredia6975  And your point is?
   yo learn english before being a hater
 @jayheredia6975  yeah my parents are proud thanks for wondering
Stop I’d acc cry✋🏼😭
 Nathaniel Hall  it’s a possibility
 Nathaniel Hall  toxic feminism is the reason so many young men get left behind.
Right! My biggest nightmare is having a kid like that 😰
 @thebae7455  my biggest nightmare is people like you existing.
 @kennedyu2953  🤣🤣🤣 this is so true
"Ikr. Imagine saying ""I love my mom"" only to later say that women are unequal and lower than men. How disgusting"
 @jessicabraud3307  did he ever say that?
 @scoopersketchy3365  you still shouldn’t be
 @rainnn..1265  Nothing wrong with believing a family should be what its modelled to be. With the man being head of his wife and his wife of his house it is they way it was intended by Yahweh.
" @scoopersketchy3365  this isn’t the 1930s 😃✋ that’s just how society deemed it to be. Yes women can do that if they want, and yes men can do what they want, but that doesn’t mean that should be the only option. Women should have other choices. This is 2021."
 @rainnn..1265  I'm speaking in the sense of raising children if you have no intent of doing it that way you have no business trying to have them.
 @scoopersketchy3365  that doesn’t make any sense-
 @rainnn..1265  because you don't understand hopefully you do end up understanding
" @scoopersketchy3365  no I understand perfectly, I just don’t get why you don’t under that THERES more than one way to raise a child 😀✋"
" @scoopersketchy3365  PLEASE WHAT- I wasn’t raised like that, and I’m fine. It doesn’t matter which way your parents worked, it’s how they talked to you, it’s how they treated you."
Going straight to the fire department
 @kennedyu2953  LMAOOO
That one hit me right in the soul.
It?😂
 @angelxsweet4402  yes he deserves to be called Derrick
Fuk that made me laugh so hard hahahahahahahahhaha 😂
@Luis Mndz lmaoooo yepp
 R D  wdym...
Imagine missing the whole point
Imma be raising my kid better than that on god
God forbid
I would be a proud dad then
So what did he do wrong??
"Problem is with people like her is that their experiences are so dark that they often spread their own darkness whilst calling it strength. I call it ""hate-preaching"" where they take a handful of really bad experiences and paint an entire demographic they've never met the same shade. You could tell half of everything she said was pandering to that audience. Like I really want to sympathize with her plight's, but she's so full of vitriol and frustration its very difficult. I know the whole ""put yourself in their shoes"" argument comes up a lot, but although its a mighty big pill to swallow spreading anger and unease helps no one."
I like the analysis
 @zaxbitterzen2178 u can’t blame her or other women who have gone through what she has
 @rxm1109  oh I wouldn't dream of it even. I'm only saying there's only so far someone can take their anger until they just start taking it out on others for no reason.
I wish that she wouldn’t use Raed as her examples of what men are like because men are actually the ones that get abused in relationships more.
You talk as if she was seriously hurt
 @vitaminprotein6878  ....what????????
That last sentence can be used for men as well.
"I also feel for her and hope she's okay but I wish for this argument's sake that the women were speaking less in anecdotes and personal experience, and more in facts. It was really not a great debate but in their defense, I'm sure I'd probably have a hard time debating with a literal incel in the room."
" @zaxbitterzen2178  you can kind of see an example of this when she went off on Zack when he asked for further clarification on things around 16:00. She obviously has so much important to say, but it came out in the wrong way."
😂
"They all agreed that men and woman should be working together, as shown here we totally can, but i think a big problem is that they are trying to change one side of the medal without touching it all(maby a bad excample?) because both sides got problems and both sides got advantages, so its just them flipping the coin all the time instead of bringing it together like some human rights movement? Thats at least what I see from this video its just them telling each other both sides got their issues to deal with, like anyone who ever wasin a relationship for mor than a month knows(explains Derricks standpoint :P). Comming from a man dunno how that helps but thats my thought on it."
"I haven’t watched the whole video yet but I’m going to guess Derrick is the guy in the yellow.


Edit: Yehp, that’s definitely him."
"I cringed at a lot of what he was saying, but also when Kursat kept insisting men was a class. Oof."
"Christine Drummond ok buddy, they both were actually making valid points and shutting down a lot of the feminists invalid points. But as a woman you probably instinctively side with the other women and blindly disagree with the other sides points just because they are not women."
"Derrick is..... Easy to hate. I don't know how some people think like this. This video made me cringe a lot... But its actually men, women and the comment section versus Derrick."
I would like the comment but it’s at 666 so I can’t
Erik Betancourt 🤦🏾‍♂️
"​ @Deeedayy  Okay ""buddy"", for one you're making baseless assumptions on my beliefs with no evidence. Let me try to put this simply for you. I was replying to a comment regarding Derrick. Then I followed up the same sentiment for when Kursat kept insisting men are a class. But how does that prove I agree with everything feminists say or disagree with everything else said by Derrick or Kursat? My reply was specifically geared for the above comment from a.a saying ""it's Men and Women vs Derrick"", and while some points are valid overall it was still cringe because they also had invalid points too. Which, is what I was pointing out. Please show me where I said explicitly said I agree with everything though, haha. I did not feel the need to elaborate on both sides as it was not part of the initial comment. Do you blindly agree with the men because they're men then and blindly disagree with women because they're women or make wild sexist accusations? My comment is akin to several others, especially regarding Derrick. So why aren't you hitting up those people too? Seriously, get a grip and stop targeting people that you automatically assume don't share your exact precious and delicate world view. It was a comment about one aspect of this video, not a comment specifying the whole video. Because no, unlike your targeted assumption, I don't always agree with women, but I geared that reply for the comment I was REPLYING to. Please learn how to differentiate and respond intellectually, instead of making baseless assumptions that make you look foolish. What a logical fallacy you have there. I wish you luck in the future."
So tru😂
Like #1000 Congrats homie
Yeeeeeees
"It sounds like you all know Derrick from somewhere else? As it can't be what he said here, Unless your or basing your idea of sexism on feminist theory and kids on twitter..."
"still watching the video (not even half way through) but wanted to say that i already understand people's feelings about Derrick. like even anyone that is on his side or agree with the general idea of what he's trying to say i'm sure are all like ""stop agreeing with us, you're making us look bad!"""
 @behising5193  want me to sign the bottom
right
ikr lmao
Lolll😂😂😂
"I partly agree with Derek, no offense, I’m just saying he’s got a few good points"
 @behising5193  Exactly. at the end of the day were all human and have baggage.
"Yeah, pretty much"
Could not’ve agreed more
Can't say derrick wasn't blowing the argument everytime
Rip derrick
" @Deeedayy  Is that you, Derrick?"
Completely agree xD
a.a HAHA
U are so right. I am a man and he made me cringe so much
I'm so here for this! :D
Lol more like Derrick V. S. Humanity
 @christinedrummond4040  damn didn't  need to do him that hard
a.a Agreed. 😂
 @tylanmdotcom  for as long as I've lived I have never ever encountered ignorance to the level you've just displayed idek why I'm addressing this but man I hope you educate yourself
"Smash or pass: Derrick. And don’t be like “Ew, no, that’s homo.”"
Zach kept looking over all confused
I hoot for Derrick
Sorry can someone explain to me why men's rights activism are sometimes seen as oppressive? What is men's rights activism about? Is it about wanting to keep their privileges like thinking being lustful is their right or is it about wanting equality like acknowledging male sexual harrassment victims? Or both?
Stella Devania 👏👏👏
Lol
 @roknroller6052  He has his own YouTube channel
"@Bella kelley... Makes more sense, I guess"
"@Stella Devania... The underlying issue isn't why is it seen as oppressive, The issues is the Marxist oppressor oppressed perspective (That lead to the gulags and the mass genocide) That's now has fallen under the guises of progressivism. The issue with this victim culture is you can't have a Victim without Victimiser..

So that perspective relies on the fabrication of enemies (predators, oppressors, victimises) out of the populace. Arbitrarily identifying perceived societal perpetrators, Just because they have money or power or whatever is convenient to suit the narrow Marxist anticapitalist - anti-democracy and blatantly anti-Western, All power is corruption ideology! That doesn't acknowledge competence, intelligence, or any marker of success, It's all external factors like, White privilege, Institutional racism and The patriarchy, That determines success void of the individual...

It's not that men's rights are oppressive, It's that marxist perspective sees all perceived normality as oppressive. Which extends to the undermining and dismantling of Western culture, political systems, tradition for one thing it's seen as patriarchal. In the west the majority are white... ""Your just a cis gendered Hetero normative white person"" It's done as a way to obfuscate peoples normality and categorise people by their immutable characteristics (identity politics). Means you can't speak on racism because you're white"" ""Your a man how dare you speak on feminism"" Your now automatically categorised as part of a collective and your viewpoints are scene as such...

The ideology is simplistic and dangerous, These people in the west that are supposedly oppressed from their marxist perspective are still better off compared to anywhere in the world, Or anytime in history!!"
Tylan Mccollum not all men are like this wth are you talking about...
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nice
😂😂😂😂
" @roknroller6052  dude, i seriously don't understand lol sorry i don't live in the west please explain it in a way a child would understand"
"@Stella Devania... Yeah it's a very complicated subject to try and explain in any depth, Is there anything specific?
That's why it's generally just labelled ""identity politics"" for ease (you can find tons of information on it, just search for it on here)"
a.a lmao yes
Words🙌
LMFAOO
HAHAHAHAH LMAO😂😂😂
Hey he said hope we gone back to the past that family are not broken and marriage is eternal. Then women destroyed it.
WHEN I TELL YOU I WHEEZED-
"Tylan Mccollum yeah that would be true equality! I wouldn’t like it but look, the feminist finally reached their goal! (Well I mean atleast if this did happen)"
ahh haha aww. I liked what Derrick had to say actually.
Bahahaha😂
😂
" @behising5193  that's why ""feminism"" isn't  really standing for equality, it stands for womens rights nothing else. If you call it equal that women should shift the power than that's a problem.

Power should not be gender based but we can see that women have today in many places more power than men.

Is it a good thing? Not really, there should be equally as much men and women in the place of power."
Truest comment here
 @tylanmdotcom  that's a thing that is based on choice feminism which is kinds outdated is about legal and societal equity so yes they can but that's a choice if a dude wants to do that so be it if a girl wants to so be it
LMFAOO
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everyone else vs incels
@Daniel idk were the reasonable came from please explain what is the reasonable statement in what he has said:)
"@Daniel like are you saying that women should just be stuck in being a housewife and mother to please their husbands and completely have no freedom in doing other things they would rather do that men can freely act like working, voting, and even going to school ? Also get raped just because women wore clothing that made them feel good about themselves."
Nope its Derrick's words vs Derrick
I'm dead 🤣
@Kuuryo I'd say yeah he blew his big moment but that is of course I feel like he wasn't talking to them but about Feminist in general with this video it was like he was posting a mean comment to a Feminist man Hater
Pretty much
Amen sis everyone may have been on different sides that day but they all were against Derek
FR!
facts
Lol yea!😂
" @tylanmdotcom  I know I'm quite late to this, but most of what you described was stereotypes that are beginning to fade. Everything you described does not apply to all men. For example, men do not always make the first move. Plenty of women are comfortable approaching a guy first. The majority of women do not expect men to help them with things they are perfectly capable of doing themselves; in fact, most women would be scared to approach men they don’t know for help because of the number of rape and murder cases of men on women. Not all women wear makeup and loose-fitting clothes and different clothes. That’s so stereotypical, it almost veers toward offensive. Plenty of men wear makeup, tight-fitting clothes, or different pairs of shoes.
It’s also important to note that almost none of this has anything to do with gender equality. I’ll admit that the homeless men to women ratio is unfair, but it’s also worth considering that when women are homeless, it’s far more dangerous to them. But when we advocate for gender equality, we could care less about who’s wearing makeup or who’s making the first move. Those aren’t points of inequality, those are untrue stereotypes.
I don't believe this challenge makes any sense, but I'll create one for men's rights activists.
Wear makeup and uncomfortable clothing in order to feel accepted by society, get pregnant and raise a child you cannot support because of anti-abortion laws, constantly question whether what you are wearing will make you feel unsafe because of the opposite gender, only be submissive (otherwise you’ll be seen as bossy rather than assertive), have crude jokes pointed at you, feel unsafe in practically every environment you’re in, get sexually assaulted."
derrdick
We have found a common enemy
Derrick is a whole new breed
Women are less strong? I'd like to see a man deliver a baby... Most couldn't handle it.
frrrr man didn't know what he was sayinggg
our real enemy is derrick
" @tylanmdotcom  I love how you think wearing fitting loose clothe or no make up is some kind of a challenge, you're living in a bubble dude you have no idea about the real world."
Derrick is weird
Facts😂
LMFAO
This needs to become top comment
Mooood
" @Deeedayy  What would you say the feminist's invalid points are? The fact that we get constantly judged, the fact that men think they are entitled to 'rule or protect' women when we can protect ourselves?"
" @christinedrummond4040  I think the reason he was calling them a class is because english (just a guess based on the heavy accent) isn’t his first language. And that’s understandable. English is a hard language to get perfectly right, and calling a group of people the wrong phrase (class in this instance) can look bad when in reality it was a harmless mistake."
 @SashedPotato  yup the comment section just hating on derrick and i'm living for it
 @behising5193  YESS
Yea I don't like Derrick
@Anyssa De Gracia you literally copied this word for word off google lmao. There’s different types of feminism. Do actual research before trying to sound educated.
Poor derrick
Yes
It's everyone vs derrick include lgbtq+
Yesss llmao
 @behising5193  you couldn't describe this better! Men and women both have their advantages and disadvantages that should always be addressed and payed more attention to
😂
derrick woke up and chose ignorance
"ok, so what if it's true? we as people should be able to laugh at a misogynistic, narcissistic, ignorant incel that doesn't represent the greater whole of men's rights."
Ha
"Yeah that's true, he's making the male gender look bad."
yes
@Mecoracon Lola no it is everyone against Derrick
" @roknroller6052  well I had no problem until he said “we should go back to the old days” “and have more kids” I’m against feminism but I’m more against humans, Homo sapiens need to stop reproducing or go extinct in the next 50 to 100 years before it’s to late"
"@Regin The Honey Badger... Yeah that's fine, I probably agree with him. The western world isn't the problem when it comes to native population growth. Actually it's critically low. 

This is the problem with the whole environmental effort, The western world is only responsible for less than 20% of global pollution, because they have been taking steps, that technology allowed, for now coming on a century. The UK emissions are like 1.7%.. So Nothing they do will make any difference, Like any country in Europe. Even taking it to the end of the century it will only return less then half degree difference, globally..

It like taking a terminally rusty car (The world) with a reliable engine (The western world) and spending your limited-  time, effort and resources on an engine rebuild, haha. It's redundant, ether focus on the main issues, or save your resources. 
For the Western world specifically, native population growth (when you have open borders lol) or pollution aren't the main issues!"
Kinda true
The comment section yearns for human rights as the Derrick's are taking over
"Most MRA and feminists fights for equality and MRA just want men problems to get solved too, along with the women problems. 
There are many feminist too who are misandrists and just want men hating and also ignores men problems and mra are just against them.
Tag does not matter. 
We should help both genders instead of fighting that who is better or who suffers more, we should for equality and HELP all genders. 
I am true feminist and true mra."

Oh absolutely
Derek is the best
Underrated comment
Women and men as in people and Derrick as in dangerous traditional customs.
YES
Yes 😂
"Yes, indeed"
LMFAOOO
LOLL

 @Deeedayy  Derrick was a sexist. You can't argue with that
 @cringeygachakidthatalsodoe7154  he’s not sexist is an incel. Sad but not the same thing. Not defending the dude. Also this a year old I don’t care for internet disputes
 @KC__1997  men can get pregnant its just not common one man named Beatie got pregnant through artificial insemination in 2007 and has given birth to 4 children since then
 @KC__1997  also men aren’t built to push baby’s out of them and if they were they could handle it just as well as any women
Lmaooo
So incels are the actual problem
facts
Incels vs the world
Teams have been randomised.

It’s the world vs derick
And children
PLZ
" @tarrinawatson7933  Derrick needs to put himself in check.
(and that sure is him)"
" @tylanmdotcom  Ok, then you go and birth some children. I respect men for what they do, bc they don’t have an easy life either. Equality means being treated on the same level. Saying women aren’t allowed to vote isn’t equality"
More like everybody vs derrick
"Yup,"
Oh yeah 🤣
🤣😂
This made me laugh for 10 minutes and now every I think about it
"Well I hope just some men are like Derrick he's annoying honestly, but I respect how Zach was understanding and trying to talk calmly."
Ayyo someone copied your comment
women are the only ones holding him accountable tho
Is men vs women...unfortunately
Is Derrick officially a gender now😂
Stella Devania toxic masculinity.
Divalicious KC there is a difference between strength and flexibility.
YES AHAHAHA
to be comepletley honest the men side is kinda sexist
LMGAOJS
Hahahahhaha

Bring world peace."

Lmfao true 😂😂
The comments are filled w/ femenists so
"no PLEASE. i’ve been saying this its not even a joke.

ITS NOT MEN VS WOMEN. 
it’s non sexism believers vs sexist people

it’s not black vs white it’s racist vs non racist"
🤣
 @ranyl7744  true I wasted 10 mins of my precious life in this
"No Admiral Ackbar, It's a trap!"
"Well, I understand where Derrick is coming from. I mean, he said that he was very traditional and if we were really talking about the old times like when men would really try everything to get a women. They would go and buy them flowers, they would pay the meal on their date, they would compete with other men because they really do like that woman, they would always be there for the woman, they won't cheat on their wife and kids. They would really be their guards (wife and kids) if there was a burglar entering the house or they met a mugger on the street, men would go and work for their family and the women would stay and raise their kids until they grow up. But now, men doesn't compete and give the best that they can to women, some would just rather catcall the women and force the woman to like them and go home with them. That's not toxic masculinity, those men doesn't have any type of masculinity in them. We cannot go and say that those men are masculine. Derrick just wants men to be what they used to be, a caring and protective people that they should be"
Lol i love how Derrick is just clearly trolling.
"He will start off with some good points and then go off on a tangent and then jump from one example to the next until he just completely dilutes his entire argument. Or he will come off very condescending and contradictory, Or just straight up say something highly inflammatory and have me talking to my phone screen like: ""Derrick...brooo"" ""I'm sorry did I hear him correctly 'rewind' "" 😂"
" @idoall1134  If that's true, he's a hell of an actor."
" @rayensabandar8392  ​  Mmm,  I think Derrick only mentioned the old times, because in the past would be easier for him to get a girlfiend lol. 
Most women could not be independent in the past, because like you said, the man was the one who got money. It was easier to control women.
I'm so grateful that in today's day woman are independent. I don't need anyone to provide for me, I can take care of myself. I also can leave someone if they don't treat me well. In the past a lot of woman wouldn't be able to leave abusive man because they weren't independent enough."
" @rayensabandar8392  Also, cheating has always been a thing. I doubt everyhting was perfect back then.
Maybe people were more discrete about it, but it sure happened. Also people would be more tolerant and wouldn't ask a divorce so easily like we do nowadays."
" @missmidn1ght  Well, to be honest, even if it was the old times, he would not get a girlfriend that easy. I mean, right now he's not very well established or very rich, that is if your were talking about money. I know back then a lot of women cannot leave their abusive husband because they cannot provide for themselves, but that's not the point. If you are talking about that, those breadwinners can't raise their kids as well if their wife left them (the stereotype in every old movies). The point is that both of them completes each other.


Today's women are independent in terms of money, yes I agree that it is a good thing, but nor women or men can raise a child independently, if either one of them left the family, the child's future is somewhat ruined, it is very proven. Yes, some would turn out to be okay, but that's not the best way to raise a child.

I also agree if either one of the person in a relationship is being abusive, the other one should leave them. No debate there. I never implied that women should just take whoever who have the most money and accept any type of abuse because they are financially dependent.


Cheating always happened, yes, my mistake was saying that it didn't. But at least they know it is bad and treated very badly if they did it. Now, I don't think many people felt that bad if they cheated on someone. It's just not being ""educated"" well enough to people about the bad things that they shouldn't be doing.


It's not the masculinity that is toxic, the education is terrible, they don't teach people as good as they did. Probably the old days was not the best, but now is definitely worse in a lot of aspects"
"It’s a trick , Send No Reply"
Exactly
Id put incell thats more accurate for no.3
 @ranyl7744  I know women am i right
its a trap!
 @idoall1134  he's not trolling he truly believes that stuff and he's embarrassed to even say it
"Derrick... I don’t hate Derrick. He grew up without a father, likely did without and I get why he thinks that being brought in a home with a woman and man would have been more ideal for him. That reasoning that developed in his childhood. He resents his upbringing. As for not getting laid, it won’t happen until he reconciled with issues about growing up without his dad. 

He will figure it out. I think he is smart."
 @rayensabandar8392  That's untrue. Women have been mistreated for centuries. In most society's women were objects until the 1900s - Now. There's a difference between treating the people around you right and treating them differently or as if they are inferior because of thier gender.
"@Rayen Sabandar if you think that man did not cheat on their wifes, or protected them and not beat them you are wrong.. Actually there have been many cases of man cheating on wifes with young boys in high victorian sociaty in Britain etc.. Also, you can be ALL OF what you said today, and still when you feel sad, come home and let your wife cuddle you and take care of you. Because today she is there for you to nurture you as you protect her. See? 
And he does not care, for me it is a torture when my partner does not show an emotions, like how am I suppose to be there for him, when he is clearly not being honest with me with his emotions? Thankfully because of the hormones man are more steady when it comes to emotion than woman. But you are still human beings."
 @ranyl7744  over half of them had degrees but okay
" @kaptynssirensong2357  ​Never thought about it like that you're probably very right, that's why he wants everyone to play their roles. It's unfortunate but I think he is pretty stuck in his ways."
" @livelyheart382  In most society's, everyone was object. Something called being a slave. There wasn't a time when men was all rich and all women was just an object to every men. During the war, who went to the battlefield? Not just world war, the war when humans were not a country as we are now. I never said women had it easy,  everyone had it hard, for every gender, it was hard and it will still is. No one got their life easier in every aspects just because they are a men or women."
" @erikacloverleaf8829  As if have replied in a more recent comment, it was a mistake for me to say that men never had any affair (read again). I'm not arguing about men never had any affair. 


""and still when you feel sad, come home and let your wife cuddle you and take care of you. Because today she is there for you to nurture you as you protect her. See? ""
I agree with this btw. well to add, men would be there to for women if they have any problems or just simply needed someone to talk to (just human being being a social creature).

Well, if your partner doesn't show any emotions, tbh it's not his duty to share it if he isn't comfortable sharing it with you and it's not really your duty too to help him cope with this problems. But, it would be great if you both did those things. I'm saying this because (like a lot of people) you feel obligated to help him, which is absolutely fine but don't put any pressure to him or yourself if you can't help him"
Rayen Sabandar sorry buddy but it was NEVER actually like that. Some of the most “upstanding” “and caring” men cheated on their spouses even before second wave feminism. Martin Luther King for example. I feel like this kind of idealistic thinking has done a lot more harm than good for humanity. Even the idea that a woman has to be “wooed” so a man can “win” her is intrinsically flawed because it assumes that a woman is an object to win through competition.
" @ky4864  I think I have made it clear that affairs do happen. I've corrected myself that I said there was a time where men do not cheat. So, tell me, what would make a women fall in love or decide if she would want to have a relationship with a man?"
"Rayen Sabandar well I can’t speak for all women. But I fell in love because of mutual respect, kindness, and communication. I didn’t play games and neither did my husband. We were honest and both took the time to understand each other’s needs. We both have the same obligations to one another. It was not his job to “chase” me."
" @rayensabandar8392  Thank you for adding additional insight. I aggree on what you said. :) Unfortunately I would not be comfortable to be around someone who does not share, but thats my personal preference."
" @MerokoNimeTakarai  yeah, it's always okay to have personal preference. Good talk :)) it always nice to have a civil debate"
"Admiral Ackbar, Derrick finna shoot the building down."
"​ @rayensabandar8392  Well what derrick mean by being traditional is just exploiting women accordingly to his will without being worried about anything. I saw too much of these type of guys... ""Traditional"" is just a catchall word where you put everything that has been done, some day, in some culture, that could benefit your personnal interest in the detriment of others people. Acutally, he doesn't miss the old time in some poetic and caring way, he just wants to easily have women without any regards to (good) personnality and looks. He takes the old times as example, only because it was supposingly more easy for unscrupulous people to get away with this in western countries, and obviously, because it looks better than just saying that you are egoist and that you don't genuinely care about people, especially people that are women. When he says that everything was better under traditional rules, he only talks about how in his mind his own life could have been positively different if women  fullfillement  as individuals wasn't an important issue."
" @golbea3933  Well, you really took a stretch there. He never once mentioned that he wanted to exploit women or doesn't want any women to not feel fulfilled as an individuals. I mean, he only mentioned that men would do all the work while women take care of the kids, which is what some families do. I don't say that's and ideal or a wrong way to raise a family. People can choose whether to have both parents work or only 1 who works (either the husband or the wife). I don't understand where you think he wanted to exploit women or perhaps you can point me to the minute/second where he said that or even say something that made you think that he implied that idea."
And the girl in white
" @ky4864  I never said about anyone playing games. You both fell in love because there's something that attracts y'all. Presumably, he did something that pleased you and you would do the same. You cannot fell in love without someone doing something that pleases the other partner. That being said, there could be someone else who just not as good as your partner in some aspects you most value, that's why you don't end up with that person (same goes to him). It's not as simple as a game where the women played hard to get and there's like 5 guys who on a daily basis did something just to win the girl over and ""beat"" the other guys. Idk if it made sense hahaha that's how I would put it, tho"
"Alisa Jeffery You have a very kind heart. Forgive me if I sound out of line, but it’s very rare (or at least for me) to see a woman/feminist sympathizing w/ a male who, even though he portrays himself as hateful, is probably suffering on the inside. I hope there are more of you out there who not only open their minds to discussion but also their hearts. Lol sorry if I sound too corny"
LOL
Frr😂
 @rayensabandar8392  yeah he wants to take away womens freedom and force someone to be his wife lol
There are two logical men and then there's Derrick
Like they couldn't find anyone else to replace Derrick for the discussion?
 @TheSolaceOfSilence  point me to the minute/second where he said such a thing or even implied it
" @billrussell4832  yeah. Maybe they could've found people who actually research these stuff not just ""activists"""
" @GoldenValleyPictures  given Derrick doesn't consider himself a men's rights activist, that would have been a good idea."
" @missmidn1ght  it's not even about independence. Anybody can be independent, it's just a matter of if they want to work for it or not.

But I think a lot of issues today come with people believing they're independent. It's a big ego/pride thing (and I dont mean only women) where people dont want help or anyone to take care of them because they're trying to make this big stand.
Were also in the middle, millenials are the crossroad between old and new, like with technology.

But in reality, most people arent independent, and never will be. Living in a shitty apartment, eating the same crappy meal, and barely scraping by while living paycheque to paycheque isnt independence."
"Rayen Sabandar idk what you’re talking about lol, but I think the point is that there is no difference between how the man and woman should behave in relationships."
Rayen Sabandar honey I think you need to go and see an episode if Mad Men. Cause the world you’re talking about NEVER existed
"No, there are two grounds, Men's rights and incels. Incels are divided into two categories, derrick and feminists.
Men's rights are divided in two camps, the practical and theoretic.
Chad is practical, twilight guy is theoretic."
" @lloydgush  I never heard about a Chad being a practical MRA... Isn't Chad simply a very attractive guy, regardless of his opinions?
And what in the world is a twilight guy?


MRAs and incels are indeed two different thinks. Agree 100%.


And incels are devided. Well only a crave to be close and volnurable with a women (+feeling grief) is what connects them, so of course they have different ideologies. But I don't understand the divide between practical and theoretical MRAs.."
" @Draber2b  I meant asian chad here.
Most chad MRAs are on the more theoretical side, yes.

A chad is a chad, is not only attractive but normative attractive, though an incel will insult any guy he deems ""too lucky"" as chad, I know I've been.
But their internally consistent definition can only be taken as either conventionally attractive or a guy who get's laid."
 @ranyl7744  Chapeau to that comment
" @lloydgush  But who is a twilight guy MRA?
You mentioned also a twilight guy."
" @Draber2b  The one in the front.
You know, the guy who looks like the main romance in twillight, though I admit chad guy looks like the werewolf guy as well."
"The PhD dude brought his research 👏 
Most impressive out of everyone else"
I see one group. People obsessed with finding validity in their chosen identity.
Rayen Sabandar I defined understand that but Derrick wants more than that. He doesn’t think men and women are equal. That’s his problem he’s sexist
Admiral Ackbar It’s a trap
Michael Jiroho ikr🤦‍♀️
"Derrick is fighting for the incel side, to bring back a traditional style that has never existed"
Exactly
LMAO!!!
" @ranyl7744  
There was one educated guy in the room but they barely let him talk."
"Michael Jiroho 
The feminists are clearly the educated and good humans between these two groups."
" @AddBowIfGirl  
How can they be educated and believe the wage gap at the same time..?
Also all of their arguements were anecdotal and emotional."
" @AddBowIfGirl  
This is also not true, studies show that women have bias towards women and men have bias towards women.
Forget the fact that in law if a man and a woman are in danger the woman has to be saved first.
Men might make most of the money but 80% of all of the money spent is by women.

You have this idealized view of women that isn't based in reality, women don't put themselves before others more than men, women don't hate less than men and you are a living proof of it."
Michael Jiroho Ya.  The only educated person in this debate was Kursat.
" @bbbbbb-dc5bb  
And they didn't give him any time to speak.
Pretty sure that they just edited him out as much as possible."
You can tell Derrick was expecting the other two guys to be like him but he got a few glares of disapproval from them
talsapps Idk what else there was for him to say.  He wants to bring back traditional issues which I have an issue with.  Zach had way better be he wasn’t entirely correct either.  Kursat was on point tho.
Michael Jiroho how edgy
Sandra yassss
Michael Jiroho  kursat bruh
Admiral Ackbar PFFT
" @rayensabandar8392  Rape, sexual harrasment, and catcalling happened in 'The good old days' it just wasn't talked about. Being caring and protective isn't inherently masculine."
" @andrewcortez1497  Rape, sexual assault, and catcalling are not masculine traits. So, I don't know what you are talking about"
" @taylorowens13  I do believe men and women aren't equal in a lot of aspects. Not saying any is either inferior or superior. If they are equal, we would not see any sport that have men's and women's sport. But they both are entitled to equal opportunities."
" @rayensabandar8392  I'm not saying their masculine traits. I'm saying that those things existed when Masculinity was apparently traditional and good, in your words."
" @andrewcortez1497  yes I know that and I have never said it didn't. All I'm saying is that we need to have the positive thing to keep existing. Sorry, if I didn't mention the bad things that the old times had, was never my intention to keep that thing existing in present days."
Michael Jiroho ok boomer
Rayen Sabandar your definitely right about that. But people are thinking that one gender is more entitled to different opportunities. I have my opinion and some people theirs but I do believe men and women are equal in some ways and different in others. Some men still don’t like the thought of a women being able to do the same things as them and they lash out. As if women are threatening their masculinity
"No one: 
Not a soul:
Derek: we should go back to the past🤩"
"Just because you don't want him to be considered a Men's Rights Activist doesn't mean he isn't. However, there is also a big difference between men bitching, moaning, and complaining online and a true activist."
Why would they have an incel LMAO
"I laughed that Derrick was a group in his own, i felt the same way."
lol
yes i see it was more or focus of a Derricks words LOL!
Tbh Derrick wasn't that bad because the other men were also bad imo
 @rayensabandar8392  Men always cheated in the old times. Dudes had whole 2nd families
my god thats funny
 @idoall1134  i dont think he is. i think he just is like that...
"Like actually tho! Uhmm all stats aside and things law involved aside, like does Derrick not sympathize for a woman... Like DUDE this girl was physically attacked and you only ""empathize"" us for the fact, we are ""lost""?? Uhmmm?!?!?!"
exACTLY
"True, Mimi too"
" @micah459  well, I'm sure that ""always"" is an overstatement. If you said ""many"", I believe it. But, ""always"" is just impossible"
 @rayensabandar8392  I mean obviously but I'm saying a lot of men cheated back then too and sometimes to an extreme level
" @micah459  okay. If you say a lot. I can agree. A lot of humans do that, unless there's a study who would do the most cheating, I would assume that's just in everyone's mind, not just men. What I mean is that, men and women would do such a thing, but it would be better if they don't"
Damn derrek
 @micah459  oh and what is an extreme level?
Admiral Ackbar hey man you got 12k likes
 @rayensabandar8392  I mean like having a whole secret family in a different city or something. That was very common in the older days and you won't really see that now
 @micah459  why do you think that is? I mean why does it not common in today's society. Where some people argue there are more toxic masculinity around
 @jackisawesome3  I thought you were being funny but he literally said it damn. That shocked me
Derrick is LITERALLY a Chad💀
 @jackisawesome3  dont use the name of the Lord in Vain
"I just think that basically men and women can never be equal because of how different we are, it doesn't mean that either is worse I just think that although some people may not be as good at things then other people (irrespective of their gender) each should be able to do the the same things still."
Im with Derrick
"Rayen Sabandar thank you, i couldn’t have said it any better 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"
AAAAHH
" @missmidn1ght  even to this day only men are drafted, if men do not register for the draft they cannot and would be jailed for 5 years. Shouldn't gender equality demand women to be drafted? Only 28 % of women egalitarian draft rest are hypocrites"
 @Blueissuperior  yet government expectt only men to be  drafted
 @golbea3933  yet traditional roles like male only draft still exist. only 28%of women want an egalitarian draft .
I'M ENJOYING A TREAT DERRICK!
Michael Jiroho yeah that sounds about right
"nah you mean 
1. Men Rights
2. Feminists
3.incles"
🤣🤣🤣
" @missmidn1ght  sure, abusive wives didn't exist in the past they are a new thing, miss genius,,,,,..........,,.."
They made a literal video about derrick being an incel
 @amorestierraamadahermoso5810  When did I said that? The fact that I mention abuse towards woman it's because it comes into the conversation we were having lol. But doesn't invalidate that it exists towards men too. gEnIuS
Admiral Ackbar That’s what I was saying the whole time 😂
Admiral Ackbar what is his yt tho
"He’s not, he’s done many videos about his views on women like this"
"Lol Derrick ""they say finding the right guy is so hard- it really isn't"" facts, but i don't really agree with a lot he says.. he sounds kind of arrogant"
I love Derrick tho
this took me out 💀
 @ranyl7744  wait u mean feminists
"No one said ""women are misguided"", they said ""feminists are misguided"", which would mean she is unable to understand, btw noone of us have rights, we have privileges and benefits as long as we agree to operate with a birth certificate, men and women have the same privileges and benefits, these two groups are very small picture people, grow up."
True😂
Derrick doesn’t deserve a voice he’s the only person that doesn’t bring up anything that is worth while
Robert Velligas yes
No he is just the very conservative part
Yes
Everybody a gangsta until Admiral Akbar responds
Michael Jiroho there was one educated dude
"Alisa Jeffery women have also avoided him like the plague.. I doubt he has any friends who are women, do you think this is because he is sexist or is it the other way around?"
Lively Heart 50% of women fought against suffrage.
U MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD so tru tho xD
"Derrick has a lot to say but don't wanna hurt them. When debating you should keep cool and not let emotions get to you and I think that's where he tried to stop himself. For example that lady that said she didn't want to fight but always saw men raging or something like that, she was the first to attack when a guy just asked a simple question to understand her."
Rayen Sabandar Women were never just taking care of the kids. Many also had jobs and were still taking care of kids. Besides taking care of children and maintaining a home is a very important job. Without the home or family why do you work?
" @missmidn1ght  I know it's been a weeks since you commented on this video /comment, but I would just like to say that I generally agree with you! I just wanted you to stick what you believe in!"
I love this!!!
Fr lmao
Even the mra's were dismissive on the issue of women but also ignore that the reason society treat men poorly is also part of the patriarchy.
"@Sandra  For sure. It seemed clear to me—whether or not it was clear to him—that all of his beliefs on the topic stemmed from his inability to get a girl. It’s like he just gave up trying and decided to create an entire belief system to justify his virginity. I might be wrong, but that’s the impression I got of him."
FACTS
 @ranyl7744  which group is that
omg exactly
" @rayensabandar8392  This time that you describe never existed in reality. It's just the glorified vision in the minds of 'traditionalists', who like to disregard all negative aspects of the past they want to reestablish"
" @kalks4334  well, safe to say, I am not one of those people who wants to reestablish the negative aspects"
Too true
 ron stetz  well he clearly couldn't say much in the video
It would be so funny if admiral ackbar actually said that
"dude that guy is what Feminist see Men's as.... Jesus what a sad little, chubby man."
Wym
" @rayensabandar8392  I disagree with this completely. First of all, there are men who still do this now. It is also not right to assume that men back when whatever year derrick was talking about didn't do the cheating or any of the bad stuff, maybe less but still. From what I got from what he said when he talked about ""old times"" is maybe he meant when men and women went married and there were no problems, as in no women's movement or fighting for rights. It could be argued that last then more men actually hit their women and no one would said anything about it."
 @saiyan5026  Read the whole comment section first before replying to me. Someone else said the same thing and I've already replied to them
Admiral Ackbar 🤣
Yes
PREECH
😭🤣🤣🤣🤣😅
Michael Jiroho true they all claim to be highly educated but they don’t look like one by their point of view
"Jiren The grey de 
“precious”"
" @kaptynssirensong2357  You nailed the difference between men and women. You gave Derrick the ""escape"" clause to his terrible behavior. You said it was because he grew up without a father. Come on 🤬. I love how people will defend the indefensible."
 @ranyl7744  I agree!!!!!!!!
"The second I saw Derrick, I thought ""incel"" and he quickly confirmed that."
now why did you choose to put Men Rights at number 1?   All women want is two groups as equals:  1. Feminists/Men's Right vs 2. Derrick
 @ranyl7744  no matter how much you try to teach women they will always be uneducated
It's almost as if they invited someone who would de-legitimise the entire argument of mens rights so they could push an agenda.
Lmfao I didn't find the other mras that bad. I thought some parts were a bit iffy. But they were interesting and respectful.
"Rayen Sabandar no, men have always traditionally cheated on women. Patriarchy only makes it worse because it gives men a sense of entitlement. Things are changing because women got fed up with the abuse. I’m not saying that men can’t also be abused by women, but I do think that we are better off now that we have more choices."
"Sandra exactly! I feel the same way. And I think that worries men because they think we won’t need them anymore. But we will always need each other, the point is that we also need the CHOICE to decide who, what, where and when!"
Admiral Ackbar Put Derrick under alpha male
*sexist
 @ranyl7744  same
Derrick was jus trolling
Lmao
It wasn't fair to have Derrick there as part of their group as he was uneducated.
There is a lot of truth in this Original Comment.
"Go to Kursat's channel for the full unedited version(he recorded everything secretly) and you will see Jubilee's obvious bias. Type ""Kursat middle ground"" and share it everywhere."
Im pretty sure he just wants to feel powerful over a woman.
Lol so true
It's a trap!
Feminism: 50 Years of Hate. We all need to work together to end this cancer once and for all
Derrick looks like a typical marxist
did you just say mens rights is superior to womens rights?
SpyCBeef they are bro
Frick Derrick
Love itttt 😂😂😂
🤣🤣
He talks too much 💀
Admiral Ackbar lmaooo
🤣🤣🤣🤣
HAHAHHAAH SOON AS HE SAID HE WAS AN INCEL I WAS OUT
 @ranyl7744  Which one?
Derrick probably wears a fedora and addresses woman as m'lady
Jeff B didn’t bring a list of their beliefs?
Admiral Ackbar thank you
GO DERRICK
 @ranyl7744  ooouuh buurn 🔥😂😂💪🏼
" @rayensabandar8392  I get where you coming from, but that ain't it. Derrick said he was raised by a single other which scares me, Seeing as I was raised as a single mother as well. She was the protector, the provider, the nurture, the read winner, the guardian and It wasn't easy so I can assume his mother had it rough as well. In the past, you didn't have to do all that to get a woman if you simpled waited long enough you could get one because it was almost impossible for a woman to survive on their own. In the past men cheated just as much if not more than they cheat now, whereas women cheat more now than they did in the past. This is due to something completely different than gender roles, Men use to catcall a lot back in the day and that was a problem and forcing women to like them was a huge problem in the workplace. You right though that's not masculinity at, but it is considered to be masculinity, the whole catcalling and quick smash is locker room talk in which the black lady was talking about getting read of.  Point is the traditional mindset encourages the idea that a woman needs a man, which ain't it, I'd be dammed if another man walked into the house and tried to run something. We often forget that in the traditional set up ONLY the male is working and as you stated the female is taking care of the kids. No females working means more jobs for males and give them the opportunity to make more money so they could provide for the entire family. The ultimate problem is money, it's how we set up everything, everything is centered around it."
" @cmac7547  What do you mean it scares you if he was raised by a single mother? Okay, I've yet to deny the fact that cheater exist in the past. I don't know if catcallers used to force women to like them and I don't know who in the past consider catcall a masculine act. The traditional mindset that I (and I think derrick) wants to enact is that there have to be someone who spend a lot of time in the house with the kids. With the women's nurture trait is generally more existent than men's, it made sense that the mother would in the end choose to spend more time with the kids. You can force it all you want, but women would take care the child better than the men, I believe men would have more capability to raise a kid in terms of teaching them motoric skills rather than staying at home and feeding them from their early lives, that's not sexist, that is based on facts. I don't understand your last statements about less women means more opportunity for men, that's not how it works, unmarried women and childless women would still very much be in the workforce and not all men have the same career interest. It doesn't make sense to say that if women would stay at home and raise a kid, then there are more job opportunity for men, like for men only. Money is never a problem, in fact, money is the answer. The problem is how one would obtain money."
It's a trap!
" @rayensabandar8392  I said it scares me because he thinks of that mindset is true. Also, a lot of women would rather not be housewife this was one of the points for women's suffrage. you pointed out unmarried women and childless women, but the thing is during this time period it was basically impossible for a woman to thrive on her own. Most unmarried married women became nuns and the rest were pretty much widows. When women did not work there were more jobs for men which did mean more money. in today's culture, double parenting usually means double income and for single parents, it means single income. the cost of living is going up and to raise a child is much more expensive single parents struggle mostly because of money issues. before a man could make as much as two people and it is enough to provide for everyone. You said that due to a female's more nurturing side that she is more fit to raise and take care of the child. You right I agree with you that is true and based on fact, but that doesn't mean a man can not do just as well of a job as a woman will. a lot of the differences between male and female is the gender roles put in place.  when I said money is a problem I didn't mean it in that way just more or less everything is based on money. More money is the solution and that's its a problem that everything is geared towards money."
" @cmac7547  what mindset are we talking about here, you said that you're scared because he was raised by a single mother. When I pointed out about unmarried/childless women, I'm talking about present times, I never said it was back then. Again, when women didn't work that doesn't mean more jobs but because of women entering the workforce, job opportunity increases. Well, single parent is never the right way to raise a kid to begin with. Well in some cases yes, a man can do the same if not better job than a woman, but generally speaking, that's not the case. Okay, if the problem is that everything is geared towards money, what would be the solution or what should we have done?"
" @rayensabandar8392  the midset that a woman needs a man. Alright, you meant as in the present time rather than before he sai go back to the way things were before and that's how things were before.  single women and childless women didn't really exist back then so that ould need to be taken into consideration. It is also the same principle when people say that immigrants come and take all the jobs. the more people the fewer job opportunity the more competition and in a lot of cases the less money. single parenting isn't right but it isn't wrong it's just not ideal. also, studies show that children of single fathers do just as well as children of single mothers the only difference is children of single mothers when it comes to negativity they internalize it and those of single fathers externalize it.  more money is the solution lol studies show that the more money you have the less likely you are to commit crimes. Honestly, though we shouldn't have made money a measure for success and I feel like that's one of the reasons money is a problem"
" @cmac7547  well actually, the child needs both parents in the household, therefore a woman needs a man and a man needs a woman. I don't get what you mean by putting it into consideration, what exactly are you talking about? It doesn't matter if a child in single father is the same as a child in single mother household, the kid need both of them. Yeah, I know, money is the answer. That's that"
" @cmac7547  well illegal immigrants aren't being hired by the rules, it's a whole lot different than when women enter the workforce. Illegal immigrants got paid under the table and doesn't pay taxes like if women entered the workforce. The point is, a particular gender entering the workforce (legally) is a lot different than any gender entering the workforce (illegally)"
 @rayensabandar8392  a child doesn't need both parents in the household you're making it sound like they will fail or not be good enough or something bad will happen to them if both parents aren't in the household. Also what about gay parents?
 @rayensabandar8392  that's a common misconception illegal immigrants do pay taxes they find legal ways of paying taxes even if they don't have a social security number they do this in hopes to become an American citizen.
Incel
"C Mac, Children definitely need two parents. Gay doesn’t matter, the number of parents does. There are a lot of studies on this. Children in a one parent household are less likely to graduate high school and more likely to end up in jail. You may have an anecdotal story about yourself or someone you know who was raised by one parent and are “doing just fine”. But that’s all it is. Anecdotal. Statistics matter. Also, have you heard the expression “It takes a village”?"
"1. Men’s right
2. Women’s rights
3. And one incel"
I just think he’s a woman hater and does not know what he’s talking about
Derrick is a kind of his own 🥴
Admiral Ackbar haha
Michael Jiroho same here
"Do you know sung jae gi
He is the most popular men's right activist in Korea 
Many Korean men admire him
I also respect him, sung jae gi, the Korean first men's right activist!!!!!!!!!"
Michael Jiroho same
Michael Jiroho The asian dude came off as well spoken and pretty educated. He presented a lot of facts.
Michael Jiroho How are Zach and Kursat uneducated?
Bill Russell Kursat isn’t uneducated tho so you can’t say that
Petrus Edward Jr. eh Kursat isn’t uneducated just not thinking about feminism. He is not even speaking really.
łøvełyłįłãç Gacha But he was right...He was thinking about feminism and just showed the flaws in it’s movement. Feminism is supposed to represent equality but you don’t see any feminism movement or protests against the court system of how bias it is against men or how men have a higher chance of getting the death penalty for the same crimes. Think before you type
"I havent laughed this hard over a comment in a long time hahaha, thank you Admiral! ♡"
"Petrus Edward Jr. I am thinking actually. He does have some good points, but I don’t hear his opinions as much as the others, if you can actually decipher what I said. He is not speaking REALLY. That is the exact thing I said. I admit, the first line was a bit inaccurate. Think before you type, and read before you say."
Danis Bo that also made me  laugh 😂
Admiral Ackbar got to love Derrick
"Alisa Jeffery . I raised 4 sons alone.  Ok so none are beer swilling, football obsessed, wife bashing bogans.all are comfortable with the idea of a wife who earns more than them, or is better educated. They expect a partner to be best friend who they can support emotionally and vice versa. I think all had a personal struggle in late teens finding out what it is to be a man. Their father had died when they were very young. I told them that he was a man of honour and he would expect no less of them.  I am very proud of these strong young men who understand that feminism is about equal opportunities for all. They acknowledge that women are poorly represented in gov,t. They understand that daily a woman dies from domestic violence in my country. They know that traditional female jobs like in social services are poorer paid than ‘male’ jobs like plumbers and mechanics. Derrick is the worst here with his ideas promoting patriarchy. I would ask him why he feels so inadequate but I doubt he has insight"
"Derrick alone, is a whole other discussion-"
HA HAHAHAHAHA
 @ranyl7744  YESSS!!!
 @rayensabandar8392  FINALLY someone who knows what they are talking about.!!!!!!!
 @ranyl7744  yea the women
Lol what's his YouTube
"22:00 is the best point made of the whole video.. of the traditional ways were to come back that stuff would most likely not have happened, we are in a generation that acts and hunks different and that’s the problem."
" @rayensabandar8392  And? The world is evolving and if he wants, Derrick could totally find his lady from the same spectrum as his. However from what i see, Derrick wants someone who is unavailable to him. He wants someone else to fit into his world instead compromising with the real world. That's Derrick's problem."
" @rayensabandar8392  No children's future is ruined just because his/her parents are divorced. Come on. Please live in the real world. It is proven that a child can still have a future with their parents divorced, their parents just need to learn to co-parent. If what you said is proven then more than 25% to 40% of the world population will have no future at all. You cannot prove it just by using your opinion. Please link us with your evidence."
" Eric Zeng  The education system is also designed to help men get ahead of women in life if according to your logic. Remember the sports scholarships? How many of them are there for men in comparison to women? Men gets more lenient rape/sexual assault sentences if the  judge is a man especially if the judge is a man who is actually an alumni from the same school system as the accused. 

Courts favor women giving them custody of children is because most men do not do the care-taking of the children in their family and it is proven. In fact, more men are given custody of their children just because the courts found them to  have stepped up the role in child-caring in the family. 
There are more shelters and social services for women because the ratio of women being abused is far far greater than men. It is also proven. That is why men are oppressors because alot of these women ended up under the violent hands of men. Proven fact. I can actually attested to this women shelter thingy is because i used to volunteer at women shelter when i was younger. Some men not only abused the women but also their children. That's why the women shelters accommodate their children too. Let's not pretend you ever live in reality or ever really worked in such places to understand the real world. All you do is to read articles and be a keyboard warrior.

I quote you ""A lot of women I meet these days have an air of arrogance, unlikeable. "" This is because you CHOOSE to meet such women. You want to be around them and you want to surround yourself with such women. 
I quote you again ""It's as if relationships are quite important to keep the mind sane that the single mind allows you to ponder endlessly on cancerous or potentially cancerous ideologies.""

This applies to men's rights activists, notice that they are single men and their single mind allows you to ponder endlessly on cancerous or potentially cancerous ideologies.
So by using your own logic, these men activists are cancerous too right? Or do you suddenly want to apply your double standards here?

I'm married and and i am a feminist. Using your logic again, i am not cancerous therefore my ideology is correct? 

You are a single-minded person who borders on cancerous ideologies that only APPLIES to one side but not the other because of your own agenda. Your statement totally applies to you. 
Please stop being toxic and be open-minded. All you do is to poison the well so that your agenda can be met. 
The world is not black and white."

 @ranyl7744  nah kursat is cool.
ikr derrick was so extra
" @rayensabandar8392  The thing is that there was a lot of cheating and spousal abuse in those days too, it just wasn't talked about.  Good examples of shows/films about this are Mad Men and The Apartment(1960).  I know these are fiction, but my parents can attest to these happening.  A lot of seemingly family oriented men(not all) cheated on their wives, or had mistresses.
My grandma said that once, in the 50s, and friend and coworker of her my grandpa's, came over for dinner.  He came up to her in the kitchen when she was cleaning dishes, made sure my grandpa wasn't in the room, and put his hand up her dress.  She told him not to do that.  When she told my grandpa, he got angry with her, and asked if she had done something to make him think she wanted to sleep with him.
That was the good old days.  They may have seemed nice on the outside, but they actually sucked."

 @ranyl7744  Please could you give insight on your evaluation of this video? I'm interested in what you think of the statements the people involved have brought up or the topic in general.
 @kaptynssirensong2357  Are you shan boody?
 @talsapps  Oh dude you are on fire in these comments.. assuming you are a dude that is.
Yes
" @RealNormHall  
Ye I'm a dude, not sure which comments but thank you."
Admiral Ackbar I am a big fan
lol
Michael Jiroho err pretty sure Kursat is educated.
CTAC Praetorian You.......Be my life coach...
" @ranyl7744  Hell yeah, people don't seem to get each other. God damn"
 @ranyl7744  right
Derrick should never have been brought into this.
" Tired  i agree but woman shouldnt get dissappointed if they dont get a manual laber job, and men shouldnt get dissapointed if they dont get a daycare job. Not discrimanation just practicality."
Derrick is going to start a war
 CTAC Praetorian  Being single or in a relationship has absolutely no premise in this argument at all.
"I was about to say something similar.  I guess Derrick thought ""It's a trap!""  I feel like that was funnier in my head"
don't forget Mimi.
 @rayensabandar8392  lol men in the past cheated all the time. Its just now that women do it to. At this point its basically 50% cheaters and non cheaters in both genders
 @jikman681  read everything first before commenting please. You're now just like everyone else who just comment after reading 1 or 2 comments
"Derrick is the group of science, he doesn't really have any true feelings he's just a walking thesaurus"
"You look familiar Admiral, have we met?"
" @Owen-ol6iv  hmmmm cant say we have, what star system are you from?"
" @admiralackbar6551  I'm from the Mon Calamari system, what about you"
" @Owen-ol6iv  interesting, so am I...."
 @admiralackbar6551  Very interesting
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
 @ranyl7744  true
"Oh my god I know I’m a bit late but f me 57k likes, like I know what I’m gonna write next time a video like this get released"
Agreed
Omfg I hate Derrick so much
 @missmidn1ght  men were forced into marriages. Don't compare all countries as to be the same for one gender as greece/roman times were not good
 @livelyheart382  Roman and Greece had forced men into unwanted marriages
 @ky4864  says the hypocrite when women treat men as if their existence is only how much they earn. Women have cheated on men just as much. Men are treated as disposable objects
 @golbea3933  way to manipulate the matter over a word by redefining it with your linguistic fascism terms of Newspeak
 @TheSolaceOfSilence  no different from psycho women
 @suncicacinglak  maybe you should watch the red pill documentary
" @alexk7880  Actually yeah, they do, though they just call themselves incels."
 @lloydgush  I think it's because people have equated to only one gender to that term that people have denied the idea the other gender can do the same
" @alexk7880  The other gender created the term.
But in my perception neither is really involuntary and most aren't really celibate."
Rayen Sabandar yeah but even tho that’s nice in theory that system prevents women from going after education or doing what they want in life like it might work out for some people but it’s a system that makes women really depend on men
" @evangelion8793  Which system?
Because system is irrelevant under functional equality and demographic majority, worst, considering functional equality and demographic majority any system in place must fit said demographic majority which is equal.
Lancaster's law, you know.

Fun thing, people hate hard labor (actually any animal hates it), people love their family (like any other social species), people hate being unsafe and in unfamiliar places, so said system didn't seem to serve the function you seem to imply it had."
lloydgush could you clarify what you mean my functional economy
" @evangelion8793  functional equality.
Defacto equality, ""equal in what counts"", of equal inherit capacity."
"lloydgush so if I, a woman want to get a physics degree does that count as part of the defacto equality?"
 @evangelion8793  but ironically no different the other way around but treating the other gender as expendable which isn't truly helping which is why major decline in birth rates have plummeted as males aren't interested in a system against them so they would rather not risk which is why they are going their own way
" @evangelion8793  Do you understand what lancaster's rule means?
It's an observable military law where the effectiveness of an army over another doesn't grow linearly with proportion, but compounds on itself.
But it's a good way to demonstrate that there's undeniable power in numbers.

And no, it's not even relevant, it doesn't add or take. We aren't talking about individuals, we are talking about populations here, right?

So, one woman wants to get a physics degree, is she equal? No, nobody is equal, individuals come with way too much variation.
But let's stick a bunch of women together, let's take a whole world of women and men, any random set is bound to be fairly equal to any other set, so let's divide girls and boys.

Interesting enough we find out we got more girls, there goes our bigger army, if there's any hill which both want to occupy I can be almost certain than in the majority of the time girl team wins. And yeah, I'm being metaphorical.

But you see, there's a hill with very few girls on, it's a very steep hill, very cold hill, very cruel hill, filled with tight crevices one must tread alone. Fun thing, there are more boys on this hill, but even boys, there's very little of them, compared to other hills it's pretty empty.

There's another hill, very tranquil hill, nice incline, but way too many people, on the top, mostly the girls, the first hilltop seems filled with girls compared to how little boys are on this hilltop. But then, boys didn't got a chance, let's be honest here.

What hills are those?"
Alex m how is the current system against them?
"Alex m and to be clear I wasn’t talking about any system in particular but just any system that allows the people within it the freedom to choose what they want to do with their life, where is the problem with that?"
" @evangelion8793  So, not something that exists or is tangible?"
 @evangelion8793  maybe yoh should watch the red pill documentary to get the bigger picture than this one sided bias
Alex m I have watched the red pill and I think it’s an interesting movie but I fail to see how it’s related to me asking what was wrong with a theoretical perfect system where everyone has the freedom to do what they want
lloydgush this hill metaphor would show a problem with society that definitely needs to be addressed but again the system itself at a base level of just giving the freedom for people to do what they want would have nothing wrong with it. Maybe there are some flaws in the system at higher levels but there should be nothing wrong with it at a base level which is what I’m talking about.
 @evangelion8793  well its more the matter of how it has only concentrated ever on one side and never both as people who have claimed and done nothing while real women who do it get targeted to be falsely accused and canceled for bringing up said issues just because its another gender. If it was true system it would have to be under totalitarian means  which would make both feel its a bit tyrannical because both would be watched over and monitored always for bad behavior no matter the gender as all definitions and actions will place them both on same level of being intolerant. As the saying goes to in order to have a utopia you need to sacrifice freedom because humans as a whole are the problem and will ruin it for everyone no matter what they are.
"Alex m I never said anything about a utopia, I just meant a system where people are free to do what they want only meaning that women are allowed to chase careers in science, politics, etc and traditional gender roles aren’t enforced is all I meant."
"Alex m obviously in such a system true equality might not be achieved and injustices would be scattered all over the place because it’s the real world not a utopia as you said. But I think a system where equal opportunities are given to all people, at a base level is the best system to have when it comes to equal rights."
" @evangelion8793  but that also means for such equal opportunity in any field means going to enforce for more human experimentation because biology gets in the way to do everything thus normalizing too much on things theorists/philosophers who made books with stories wouldn't want people to pursue if it means devaluing the human as a whole. 
But the major matter now is that people who claim that they are pursuing it aren't what they claim as tolerant  because they aren't in for taking precaution to make sure it's safe and would rather sacrifice others for their narrow minded view than looking at the bigger picture to really get everyone involved to help."
Alex m how does biology get in the way of doing a job?
 @evangelion8793  depending on the the job if it's more physical obviously as not every job is some office job as hard labor is the factor along with high risk jobs in labor jobs. If some weren't susceptible to value their own life to actually have more get into said jobs society would grow faster in at such a rate lol.
"Alex m but where is your actual evidence that women being in labor jobs seriously prohibits a society from advancing... women may not be as physical strong as men on average but they are not helpless and they can get pretty strong, again not as strong as men but definitely enough to not be a major setback. Most men in the labor industry are not bodybuilders either. Besides why are we even talking about labor, if women want to go into those kind on jobs why not, again you’re gonna need to put some evidence up on that putting our civilizations any significant amount behind, but I was talking more about stem and business jobs anyways."
 @evangelion8793  and that's the matter at hand because of only said focusing on those jobs you placed which is like trying to squash everyone into an area that can only fit and get enough because even said jobs you have listed have limits because they have to balance how many people VS how much they get in return for their performance to divide a portion to the people depending on hierarchy of said jobs of importance thus it would only increase if focused on pursuing on those than expanding to EVERY job and enforce said people to be to handle it to situations beyond. Yes some construction on anything dirty dangerous jobs has tried but only get few because less interest and less advertisements when it looks better on something cleaner professional sense as that form of job
Alex m women have been working in those fields for decades and nothing like that has happened. Either give me some evidence or any other reason that women shouldn’t be in those fields.
He’s really just saying men have it hard sometimes
Lol

AHAHAHHAA OMG
 @dub814  aww I was gonna say that :(
More like 3 is we dont talk about him
Me:🤣🤣🤣
 @rayensabandar8392  this is a delusion yes back in the days men were expected to be gentlemen but slimballs arent a new concept they have been existing. it was worse back then because when a women was absed or raped in marriage that was considered normal and it was just a husband teaching his wife to obey him. If a women was raped outside of marriage she was considered used and unwanted left out of society. Times were not as cute as people make them seem. plus alot of what the mens right actvist were talking about was caused by the patriarchy
I am an equalist
Rayen Sabandar YES AWESOME VIEW POINT 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Sandra it would be harder if you are competing with other men.
yea Derrick is giving me kind of a weird vibe
Lmfaoooo ahhhh
Omg 66k likes DAMN
What did Derek say?
Derrick is lost...he has his own side ...

Lmfaoooo
Yep
gettin close to 69k lesss goooo
 @rayensabandar8392  along with restricted female rights if the government said we're going to start doing this and enforce the old ways that would mean no female soldiers cooks etc any job that a female could do and severely restrict the economy
"To be honest, I understood the mens rights activists’ reasons, and that should be a part of equality. But I think derric just has mommy issues"
" @ranyl7744  Only uneducated people are the women, an to an extent Derrick. I agree with some of his points, but some of the other points are, let's just say questionable..."
😂😂😂
 @ranyl7744  bruh one of the guys has a phd
Lol
 @rayensabandar8392  Men would cheat then. Domestic abuse was a big issue. And women were often handed to men without the women's permission. Im sorry but this comment is incredibly wrong.

"although, I don't think Derrick would be a very good guard to his family, I mean look at him."
"Hey Admiral Ackbar, we haven’t met before but I heard you knew Luke Skywalker. I used to be best friends with his father until the fall of the Jedi order. Tell Luke I have information about his father and to meet me on Naboo."
For real. That's not that he ain't with no one. That's that NO ONE IS WITH HIM
"Rayen Sabandar men cheated and beat their wives and kids and society didn’t give a damn lol. I understand your point, though. But if Derrick really wanted men to be caring and protective, his behavior and his words didn’t match with his beliefs. He laughed when the women stepped up and spoke their opinions that he didn’t agree with. He also gave off a very “your opinions are ridiculous, facts over feelings” aura. As a men’s rights activist, he wants men to have more rights and in the old days, men basically had control over everything. They run the businesses, they “man” the house, they work, and I think this is what Derrick meant by that. Men controlled society, women didn’t have a voice which is why it was so “peaceful”, because even if a woman sobbed and begged for someone to help because her husband was abusing her and possibly the children, everyone would believe the husband over the wife or consider it just “his rules”. It wouldn’t get the attention of government or anyone that could help, because it happened all the time and was considered minuscule. I hope this actually made some sense Lol"
"elenabob , he is one guy. Not all little boys raised by a single mother acts like this."

HAHAHAHHAHAHA
 @idoall1134  he’s not lmao. He’s admitted to being an incel
"1. Mens Rights
2.Feminists
3.Marriage and Traditional family values."
 @missmidn1ght  Its because there won't be more kids that grow up like him without a father. If men and women grow to value and practice traditional marriage there would not be any more Derricks.
Derrick bobby debirson
" @rayensabandar8392  so, to sum that up, he was comparing women to children in the way that he believes that they are weak, therefore, he is being misogynistic."
Derrick is frank.
this comment made me laugh so hard i cried
Yes

Bro the amount of likes...
"Love em or hate em, Derrick was spitting some facts"
Hi
Lmao
 @ranyl7744  true
"more like 3 gender : male, female, and a tank t-90"
 @rayensabandar8392  so that rules out adoption by single people or by same-sex couples. Do you realize that?
Two are based.. one is cringe (of course Derrick)
 @idoall1134  is he?
HA
What about masculinity is team of men and yeah guys and girls are different and all but why do a lot of women think that they are so much better and all that saying kam and that men are useless is sad guys have feelings and ppl tell men to men up when a men speaks up about their feelings or mental health issues and yet ppl just ignore and don't really care
😂
Four the intersexual feminist pissed me off
Preach
" @rayensabandar8392 That’s the problem though, these toxic men always existed? Women were catcalled back in the day, harassed, raped. These things aren’t new? Women were cheated on and beat by their husbands back in the day too? Men back then weren’t any better than men nowadays it just wasn’t talked about as much. And if someone wants a traditional marriage they 100% should however it should be by choice."
" @ranouma147  yeah bad men will never be non existent I guess. what you are saying are true but not the majority. It was and still is a minority of men and women who do bad things and a minority of men and women who experienced the bad things. 

yeah I couldn't say which men is better but people ""back in the day"" built the world you can enjoy now. 

are you saying traditional as in the men work and women take care of the home?"
" @rayensabandar8392  Look I completely see where you're coming from, however, I believe that the abuse and blatant disrespect that you have talked about that we see in our modern day is not 'new' or something that has been introduced into our society recently. I believe that the idea that women can speak out about the trauma that they have faced, now that divorce has become normalised, that there are support systems out there for women struggling with domestic violence, this is why we can see a change in how men are treating women, not because it is new, but because we are finally able to see it, and it is no longer being hidden away from us."
LOL
As a girl I completely agree
"We want to. That's why the patriarchy needs to go, it's hurting BOTH genders"
⁠ @amarzya445 then we will replace it with a matriachy one
 @suvarniski  how about a matri-patri-archy
This is where it's at. I don't label myself feminist but rather a supporter of gender equality for exactly this reason.
"Same! And feminism is what that is, it’s abt equality not just pro women. The most prevalent issues affect women at the moment though with our bodily autonomy being taken time and time again in laws"
 @amarzya445 the patriarchy can only go if the understanding of it evolves past men long dead created it and into for thousands of years everyone born into it props it up.
" @KSull6736 I mean it doesn’t really take your bodily autonomy away. You still have tons of choices, just one less and still infinitely more then men do."
 @amarzya445  there is no patriarchy there’s only Derrick and he will beat you to the ground
 @amarzya445 parriarchy isnt real no system advantages men today in fact its the e opposite
"that’s what feminism is supposed to be. supporting both men and woman, and then having fully equal rights. unfortunately in modern times feminism has been twisted so much that a lot of people view it as fighting for woman to be superior than men."
feminism focuses more on women’s issues but at the end of the day it benefits both men and women..
"@@cakenja1993 i think it really depends, some people take it too far, but that doesn’t mean that modern feminism is all bad. i would gladly call myself a feminist, just maybe not in the way a lot of people consider. but yes, i do understand why people wouldn’t want to associate with modern day feminism."
​ @alexusmiller8325 no it doesnt. Thats why we need a Mens movement.
 @Vishnuk-fe9iv  i like how you don’t even ask what issues it tackles lol… you just say “no” instead of asking for enlightenment and knowledge… you’ll never learn anything if you don’t ask questions…
Maybe if feminism wasn't a thing then we wouldn't be having this problem
that's terrible too @suvarniski 
"That's exactly what feminism stands for, equality and understanding between both genders. Not fighting, I wish some men would realize that we want to help them too!"
how exactly? @virgobutcaye 
Exactly
​ @virgobutcaye  Then name is equalism. Why FEMinism
​ @alexusmiller8325  So what does FEM in feminism stand for
 @ToThoseWhoGotHurtByMeIAMSORRY  you know and i know what it means. what’s the purpose of this question?
" @Vishnuk-fe9iv Men don't need a movement, because the world is already for you. You are not opressed."
 @ToThoseWhoGotHurtByMeIAMSORRY Because it's for FEMALES.
 @ToThoseWhoGotHurtByMeIAMSORRY The liberation of women from the patriarchy.
 @psycherevivedby  Cool!! Hope they get it
"“When you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.”"
The actual title: everyone's rights vs Derrick.
“i don’t believe women and men can be friends” tf he on about
"Zach thank you for showing up actual thoughts, experiences, suggestions, empathy."
The fact that none of  the guys walked up for toxic masculinity is actually very surprising to me
"20% of the comments: opinions on the topic 
80% of the comments: Derrick"
"Every time Derek said the words “even women”, the camera did an Office style pan over people’s faces because they are grossed out"
"Trying to dismiss the other side isn't helping find a middle ground, coming in with the mentality of winning the argument doesn't help either. Jubilee should chose people who have well immersed themselves in these kind of topics."
The moment Derrick Called himself an Incel it's been so over 💀💀💀
"Derrick: I’m a youtu-
Everyone: I’m gonna stop you right there"
The disappointment on the women’s faces when Derrick talks...
"Derrick is like extra sauce to a Pizza. Pizza itself is already well seasoned, we can enjoy it alright as it is. But sometime some people be curious to see how it’d be with extra sauce which is basically unnecessary"
"The only people that ever want to ""go back"" to the way ""things were"" are always the ones who enjoyed a privileged position (or think there was one for them) in that prior reality. It's never about helping a disadvantaged people gain/regain parity."
All the women facial expressions when derrick speaks is killing me 💀💀
i think that everyone here just aggrees that they hate derick
It speaks a lot about our society at the end when the women all hug and are happy and the men give cold handshakes to one another
"Kursat came in with facts and a ton of research, respect to that. 

Felt a little off when he got told ""I know that you came with your little research"". 16:40"
"2 men’s activists and a discord moderator
Vs.
3 feminists"
When Derrick said he’s a YouTuber Aleysha’s face had me dead.
"I think this is a really important discussion to have. Bridging this gap is important. Being a traditionalist, I will always acknowledge that many women have experienced terrible things. Some at the hands of men. I feel for them and will always validate those experiences. Using blanket statements like men’s response to feminist idealogy (albeit certain aspects) is angry or toxic is not the way forward. We must ALL listen to each other to truly find the middle ground."
Was trying to find the words for it. Thank you
but.... what we have is not a equality! not even close!
​ @ruslanagadzhanyan2753 Correct; The point is that there is pushback against social equality because those who are privileged feel offended by it
" @pinkflare13  not at all, you wanna tell me that something like presumption of paternity is equality? You wanna tell me that blatant bias against men in courts and during police encounters are equality? You wanna tell me that woman having an abortion option meanwhile men are solely at a mercy of woman and/or hope that condoms that he use is not faulty... basically accountability for men, but not for women, how is that equality? Let me reitterate I am not against abortion, in fact I am very much pro abortion, but just like I personally want abortion to stay, I also want paper abortion for men to be introduced.

I am sorry, but your words ""oh you just mad that your priviledge is going away"" is projection in its pure form, vast majority of men in 2023 myself included, do not care if women would have equal rights as us, we do not mind that at all, where we start complaining is when women receive more perks that us or preferencial treatment in the places where things should be equal like in the courtroom."
this one sentence could silence so many toxic femenists bro
 @veer8431   it’s a reference to the men actually….
​ @cruiseny26 crazy
"​@ruslanagadzhanyan2753 women have the most say in an abortion because they are the ones who have to carry the baby. also, it hasn't always been like that and it still isn't like that all the time"
"Who women? You have higher access to education, preferential treatmwnt in the workforce and court systems. Women were not allowed to vote or work historically and men were forced into war and brutal labour. How is any of these “privileges”"
"""When you're used to preferential treatment, equal treatment feels like discrimination."""
 @mattleofric1766  exactly talk about taking away female privileges and they a t like they are being discriminated against
⁠​⁠ @hallowakers3d2y It’s a privilege because the men in power are the ones who made those decisions. Women haven’t ever had the power to send people into war or force people into labor. Men did all of that. Other men are the reason for this “inequality” you’re talking about.
This comment applies to women not Men.
"""When you think equality is oppression, privilege feels like equality"""
⁠ @ruslanagadzhanyan2753 These are some valid concerns. Please take them up with all the men in power. BTW have you ever considered that maybe the reason why men get treated more harshly during police encounters is because the police assume women are weaker and less of a threat just like so many men’s rights activists seem to think?
" @ruslanagadzhanyan2753  women have reduced standards for everything preferable treatment in all aspects of society including school, work, court sustems, social services. All the most important aspects of life. we passed equality thirty years ago. We overcorrwcred"
feminism is not abt equality anymore @pinkflare13 
⁠ @cruiseny26 but in a near future it’s going to be a reference to the women
"Inequality is the mother of oppression, if it is deep rooted within you to consider someone ‘not equal’ to you on various parameters including colour, gender, or religion for eg., then you will consider that individual is below you and do not deserve the same rights which u are entitled to, n that is a problem to say the least."
THIS! this sums it all!
Was this aimed at the mens rights activists or femenists
No it applies to men.
"​ @hallowakers3d2y     majority of jobs still have higher men than women. Plenty of women in courses like computer science and engineering admitted its not bc they don't want to pursue those education, but bc they felt unsafe in a space of majority men. That's anything but ""passed equality thirty years ago"""
" @nasrinnski  Feeling unsafe doesn't make you unsafe. Biggest problem for women today is thinking with their emotions. Equality doesnt mean 50/50 representation. Equality means equality of opportunity not outcomes. Their is not a majority of jobs with more men, their are plenty of jobs with majority women. This doesn't mean anything. Your entire premise of we need 50/50 sex split is complete nonsense and useless and can only be achieved by discriminating against one sex or the other."
"@hallowakers3d2y      there is no such thing as thinking only with emotion, everyone will use both logic and emotions with slight preference to another. There has been multiple cases of women feeling uncomfortable in a job where they've randomly assigned to clean toilet or make some tea, when all of them do office jobs. I didn't even mention ""50/50 splits"". And if you are in a space that made degrading comments on women, then yes they will feel unsafe
Job opportunities are not the only sign of equality between gender. There is also access to healthcare, housing, etc etc"
​ @cruiseny26 beyond delusional
"​ @nasrinnski what about men feeling unsafe around women oriented enviroments ? 
For example teachers / schooling / office tax workers. Majority would be a women, I dont feel thats equal :) and men should feel threatened about not 50/50 distribution. Feminists should do something about it and lay off some of their workforce to make it more equal"
" @demiruth1326  do men that felt unsafe by women in jobs occurred so much so that majority of those jobs are worked by women? Give me study, statistic, example. Nowhere did I say individual cases won't happen, its absolutely possible for men to be victim of another women, but if you look at it with the bigger picture, these are not as significant as vice versa. If anything, men can also be victim of patriarchy, women from those life tend to also have misogynistic mindset

Why do you only expect women and feminists to talk about these issues, as if plenty of feminists haven't done it already?  Why not talking about it to other men, or anyone who didn't identify themselves as feminists to begin with?"
HAHAHAHAAHA
Lmao
Fr
Yes
Yo Derrick isn’t in the wrong! No one is it’s just beliefs like if you were Christian and I’m atheist! We can still respect eachother and our own beliefs
 @ericawilson9490  he’s not denying people’s rights at all?!
 @ericawilson9490  that’s not what he said he just compared that they need to be protected! He has an opinion even I don’t agree with it but imma defend his opinion only because you’re aloud to have one!
HAHAHAHAHSHSH
 @brianhawkins3099  Stop the troll.
" @brianhawkins3099  you see, that’s the problem with free speech. Your freedom ends where someone else’s begins. His opinion is literally against women’s rights"
 @ericawilson9490  umm no that's not true  women are better with children I'm 12 and iv  always wanna do cooking and cleaning but my mom.tells me it's not for boys your a man so we have same rights but different roles
"Good one, Jotaro"
 @brianhawkins3099  I can't picture Derrick coming to the defense of anybody.  He seems delusional.
Lol
That is way better!
 @brianhawkins3099  bro everyone so mad at you bro. I agree wit u on this one.
 @user-nc6ci6fk5g  yeah man I don’t agree with Derrick but I think everyone deserves an opinion
and I agree with you there as well bro
 @user-nc6ci6fk5g  thanks man
np
" @brianhawkins3099  lol human rights ain't a belief buddy,, good try though, C+ for the effort"
 @icyaria  that’s your opinion you see what I mean 😂
Equal rights vs Derrick
"I generally agree to valid arguments of both sides. 
most MRA fights for equality and they want men problems to get solved too, along with the women problems. 
There are many feminist too who are misandrists and just want men hating and also ignores men problems. 
Tag does not matter. 
We should help both genders instead of fighting that who is better or who suffers more, we should for equality and HELP all genders."
 @brianhawkins3099  did we not watch the same video...? 💀😭
I agree with y’all but it still ain’t a good look to be dumping on the poor lad....
They need to change it to this
Gwizzyy like some of my closest friends are female I dint see what’s wrong about it
 @eoghanjones9042  my closest friends are all men. Wtf are you on about
"I learned from this video I “shouldn’t” be friends with my many Male friends 
😂😂😂😂"
 @Nora-yb9jw  What are you arguing?
Honestly dude
My best friend if two years is a guy. Like wtf am I not allowed to be friends with dudes.
Nora I think eoghan is a man and has female friends. That’s what he was “on about”
"i mean women, like if you want to you know coughs GET IT ON, if you know ummm.. sneeze in the distance um you need um to to actually you knw be their freind friend then you knw itches backhair want to have chil-d-r-en."
I am Acewicz what?
i thought i couldn't even get a friend no matter what
 @eoghanjones9042  lol
What about his parents
i have been friends with a boy for almost 3 years what is he on about
Hes talking about how it could be hard to imagine a friendship between genders without one side atleast gaining some kind of liking towards the other at some point
We can be friends l. However sexual thoughts will always  be there
@Jrpg Fanatic chief go back to rpgs the stats more sense then what you just whipped out
@Jrpg Fanatic chief what are you on
@Jrpg Fanatic your calling me simp but you the kinda guy who would simp for trump
@Jrpg Fanatic shush
I literally have 3 guys best friends that I have known for years.
He just down bad af
My best friends are guys
I have only men as friends lol
Damn y'all have friends?
 @eoghanjones9042  same
" @poloraf  to be honest, even though i am disgusted to do so, i did, and guess what i don't have that friend anymore, i had to go to his house because he wasn't answering my calls and tell him i was completely joking , that it was a dare from my other friend . I know that starting an argument with a stranger  wouldn't do me good and a waste of time, but i just wanted to prove that  you are wrong."
" @shahedalskhny3975  so you proved my point? Damn you broke that guys heart, alright."
" @poloraf  i don't think you know how to read, but you do you bud,"
" @shahedalskhny3975  please explain, how did you prove me wrong?"
 @poloraf  that's not true believing so would be naive just because I am a women with a bond with a man doesn't mean it automatically sexual.I can have a strong bond with a man with it completely being platonic
Fr
 @Nora-yb9jw  he’s literally agreeing with you
I am a woman who are friends with both and make sure both genders of friend treat each other nicely
I'm a boy and most of my friends are girls lmaooo idk wtf he's taking about
True im literally gay and most of my friends are women.
Ikr my best friends is a guy (I’m a girl)
I think in the majority of cases they can’t be. Feelings always come between.
It’s cap 🧢 anyone that believes otherwise let’s debate
 @Nora-yb9jw  What are you trying to argue? You’re basically agreeing with the comment.
"Derrick has no friends. Thats why he’s bitter. Think about it: if you were such a outgoing like-able person, tons of people would love to be around you and would want to talk to you. That’s also why he can’t get a job, you need to be like-able for a workplace to hire you."
"Unless the guy is effeminate or the lady is tomboy, men and women can't be friends, from my experience."
 @chrislavey1465  from my experience they can.
"You are not attracted to every girl that talk to. And I am not attracted to every guy I talk to. Yet we have all talked to guys and girls who are entertaining, talented or intelligent that we can work and exchange ideas with. So your argument is nonsense."
"Laura Carbonaro, Female friends are sly. One minute you're chatting in the park; next minute, she's showing you her bedroom."
" @chrislavey1465   you know damn that not all women do that. You know that very well.  So let’s not box anybody the same because we are NOT. Plenty of smart and interesting women are out there in the world, who offer great ideas and can be very interesting to talk to, which means you can get along with those women. And you know it"
" @lauracarbonaro5516  There is always someone with ulterior motives. However, you are free to be friends with whomever you like."
" @chrislavey1465  For the last time, Men and women can exchange ideas and have great conversations with each other. That means they can get along and be friends."
" @lauracarbonaro5516  I've had many female acquaintances who are smart and interesting, but the problems arise when I make them ""close friends""."
" @chrislavey1465  So becoming close friends makes you automatically “sexually” attracted to each other? Give me a break I literally have guy friends who I knew since elementary school, and they NEVER turned sexual. Again, you missed the point"
" @poloraf  and no there is not always “sexual attraction”, because you aren’t attracted to every girl that exists just like I’m not attracted to every guy that exists. Like I already said, there’s plenty of men and women who share ideas, shares interests and have great conversations with. You’re whole statement is null and void"
"​ @lauracarbonaro5516  There are qualities that your male friends have, which you would also want in a husband, given that you enjoy their company. Furthermore, my initial statement acknowledged that there are exceptions to the rule."
" @chrislavey1465  Men and women can be friends and often times do see each other as friends. Romantic feelings are completely separate, sometimes you can enjoy a person’s company without having any romantic feelings."
" @lauracarbonaro5516  You said ""sometimes you can"" which supports my initial statement. Stop playing games and just say you agree with me."
" @chrislavey1465   playing games?? 😂 I want to say we agree, but you are the one who is still stuck on the belief that women and men can’t be friends. And i have given many examples on why they can. You are the one who seems reluctant to agree"
" @lauracarbonaro5516  You ""want to say we agree"", ergo you do agree. I said they can be friends under certain conditions (e.g tomboy, ....). Have a nice day, Laura. 😃"
" @chrislavey1465  Nope i still don’t agree and this is exact reason I don’t agree with you. You don’t have to be a “Tomboy” to have guy friends. And I have already stated those reasons, some people are smart/ pleasant individuals and are great to surround yourself with.  That’s a part of human intelligence."
" @lauracarbonaro5516  Are you a feminine woman and are your male, close friends masculine men?"
" @chrislavey1465  and yes actually many of them were soccer players growing up, so they are pretty athletic and masculine. Some are even family friends."
its probably because he gets attached very easily
Especially since they say they are activist for men!!!
I think they had a misunderstanding of what toxic masculinity is. I think alot of people think we're saying that masculinity is toxic but no we're saying that there are ideas of how men should behave that are harmful to others and themselves.
 @aliaab123  I think toxic femininity should have been discussed too
 @aliharis4266  yeah I agree
 @aliaab123  I am glad you agreed
"⁠ @aliaab123 right i feel like men think when we say “toxic masculinity” we’re saying that masculinity in general is toxic, which we aren’t. men should be comfortable to do certain things without feeling like their masculinity is being threatened by the weight of all these expectations set on men by other men."
​@frog3630 These expectations are not just set on men by other men. It's also set on men by women. Yall act like women haven't been telling us for years what yall want and how yall want it.
You think ladies would agree there are toxic aspects in modern feminism? Like manipulative lies about rape culture in the west or reasons behind the “wage gap”
 @ivandankob7112 I as a feminist and woman agree that some aspects of modern feminism are toxic. But i would like to know what you mean by rape culture and wage gap?
​ @frog3630 Elaborate on toxic masculinity
"​ @Koichi218  not that you believe in the patriarchy, but your comment is proof that everyone is both a perpetrator & victim of the patriarchy."
"I mean,, Derrick is kind of a big deal"
he is the video
"Exactly lol it’s annoying af when you’re scrolling through the comments trying to find meaningful conversations on the topic trying to see people’s opinions and even learn something, and all you see are comments about Derrick."
"lol, not even 80%💀💀"
" @akilbrazier1421  
He is annoying"
 @katied9206 you’re annoying
"It's because the left is the master of optics. They present ""their truth"" instead of an objective reality."
"American Son yah nothing is wrong wi he presenting your opinion as you are doing here. Yes people with beliefs will present opinions that’s not a conspiracy theory. If you made this video it would have a heavy right slant, and that’s ok."
@Jason Tang yeah but um...equity for what exactly? They get what they work for as do men
Jason Tang Preach!
"​ @simonjaz1279  

yeah but um...equity for what exactly? They get what they work for as do men

When feminists say they want ""gender equality"" they want ""equal outcomes"" (achieved by treating the sexes unequally). MRAs want ""equal treatment"" and believe that since women and men are equal, both sexes should be treated the same."
Jason Tang not true. so far from the truth
"he makes good TV though, and good marketing as a youtuber. just check how many comments are about him. every publicity is good publicity"
 @ne2604  no it's pretty accurate
 @DemonsCrest1  well that much I easily understood lol
Alright here me out feminism is cancer but dereck is worse
"Derrick seemed like a Jerk everyone else was so mature and articulate and gave really well informed arguments, it felt so professional if it wasn't for him"
 @Heejinbunny  Derrick was the biggest issue in the mens rights side.
"Even tho it's a wonderful idea to raise the quality of those arguments, it's not something that would benefit the views and etc. The amount of people who felt the urge to write something about the yellow dide is insane and lots of comments  is what gets videos recommended to other people"
nessie now has a phone why do I feel like Derrick only got one like on his YouTube videos
I literally said oh my god here we go 🙄
That black womans face when he said youtuber lmao
Bro
garlic bread thats exactly what I did lmao
"What’s his youtube channel, I wanna roast him"
" @Smoovkillalot  me too my man, me too"
Ha Ha Ha. Derrick didn’t last a minute before he gets roasted.
he also said he is a incel so...
Eric Cartman sorry what an insult?? Yeah he is an insult to humanity.
"Omg, yes. The second those words came out of his mouth, I had to prepare myself"
licorice LMAOOOOO
Obviously plays fortnite with 12 year olds and screams and cries when he loses.
" @theshepherdsdog  And when his mom tells him to do chores, he whines and throws a fit"
I can only imagine what derricks channel looks like
I know lol! When i heard him speaking i was all wait whaa??? Why do you call yourself a second name. From that point i knew everything he was going to say was not going to be my cup of tea.
" @lumine9595  i agree with your statement. To state one gender by their activity is in fact gender bias and sexist. I think everyone needs to stop describing a gender by an activity, people are worth more than that."
AHaHaHahHa
LMFOAOOO ONG
you hating on you tubers and here you are watching you tubers...o the irony...
I bet he has at least 0 subscribers
A woman who thinks Being a YouTuber isn’t a not a job
ActuallyLeah  what’s his YouTube channel?
Humpty Dumpty lmao I think he deleted his account. Can you link it
LOL!!! OP this is a great comment! Thanks for a good laugh
"As soon as he said ""I'm a YouTuber"" I was like ""Yep you're banned from this conversation"" 😂😂😂"
"I like YouTubers, but if you try to flex that you are a YouTuber, then that's not a good thing. Most YouTubers try to keep their channels secret and separate from their private lives."
But jubilee is a YouTuber so that's the end of that argument.
why mock someones view and judge their profession? this channel seems to be pretty successful
he's got that youtuber body he was made for this
this is so one sided .... man women wound should be offended !
Your comment has more likes then the one pinned by Jubilee. Congrats
"Omg i thought that too ! 😂
High five still 😂"
 @Smoovkillalot  brendioeee his YouTube channel
He makes one crappy vlog and he feels like David Dobrik 😂

😂
i mean i think zach is too soo
Lmao
I’m also a YouTuber
WHATS HIS YT CHANNEL WE SHOULD FAIRY HIS COMMENTS
"I literally heard him say ""I'm a Youtuber"" and paused the video and said ""Of coooouuuurrrssssee"""
"""You shouldn't have said that"
I feel bad for him Youtubers in general aren’t liked and they have more “Finetuned” opinions
 @anitadimaya  all our faces when he said youtuber
HAH THIS MADE ME UGLY LAUGH 😂
 @anitadimaya  she has a name
But what makes this comment even better is the Korra pfp like yes-
" @jacen884  Most Youtubers I know are eager to show their face into the camera. I know only one, perhaps two, who hide their face."
"Why do people hate ""Youtubers'""?"
 @Viewable11  Because sometimes they are toxic
 Eva From Wall-E  I tried clicking on the link to his channel but even YouTube doesn’t wanna go on that greasy ass’s page 💀
i rlly wanna know his channel now
Pffff
"So they found the most calm composed women as feminists and found a 17 yo dweeb as ""men's right activist""? Who are they kidding here with not talking sides. This is the most basic uninformed garbage ""discussion"" I have ever seen. Highschool kids would bring up more points."
Literally 😂
 @cadengriffiths2036  same 🥲
We have the same pfp
FR
literally
 @lumine9595  Because mostly males do gaming
Not me
 @Smoovkillalot  BrendoEEE I think
 Army Videos  hating someone because they're female/male
lol
"When he labeled himself as ""Incel"" then claimed that was by choice I immediately knew nothing he said would be relevant."
And the men’s tbh...
everyone looks disappointed when derrick talks hahahah
 @joaopedroflausinodelima9147  ikr
Yep
The disappointment on everyones face when derrick talks
 @natalyajones9392  u clearly dont know what parasite means lol
 @imhachi6500  define parasite for me then
 @natalyajones9392  A parasite is an organism that lives on or in a host organism and gets its food from or at the expense of its host. so basically you are saying derrick is harming his mother in the whom for 9 months. anything else?
 Avalanche  fax feminists too
Poor Derrick
 @iloveemiliaandrem9443  no i am perfectly aware that I hate myself
" @natalyajones9392  I was expecting you too insult me and then we go back and forth leaving behind an angry comment chain.

But I never thought your comment would strike a chord with the soul of an arrogant,egotistical and disappointment of a human being like me."
Deadass
" @natalyajones9392  Actually they do, that is the definition of parasitism, parasites must also be of a different species so a baby cannot be a parasite to it's mother."
" Quantum x Relativity   I know hating oneself isn't bad but I do think hating yourself because you harmed someone without knowing it is wrong.

 It is impossible to not hurt someone. Humans unconsciously hurt others by simply existing. Whether you are alive or dead, you keep hurting people. Getting involved will hurt them, but trying not to get involved might hurt them too. But if it's someone you don't care about, you won't notice you've hurt them. What's important is your awareness of it. It's because you care about them, that you feel like you've hurt them. Caring about someone means being resolved to the fact that you'll hurt them. The more people care for each other, the farther out of reach certain things get. But that's not something to be sad about, I think it's probably something to be proud of.



Btw I took this quote from a charater in an anime called snafu no way my tiny brain could make a quote this good but this automatically came to mind when thinking of an appropriate response."
ffrrrrrr i thoguht i was the only one seeing it lol
" @natalyajones9392  Imagine thinking like this as an actual human being...So disgusting, so disgusting...."
Men and women shouldn’t be friends?????? I feel sorry for him man
The disappointment on the women’s faces when Derrick talks...
I think they all get the vibe he hates both women and men for embracing the end of traditional values. He said he was an incel and those guys have commited terrist attacks on both men and women. So I would say it's a feeling of sitting next to a guy that might do that you.
I feel bad for them
Just the look of sheer cringe from both the men and women when he mentioned he was a youtuber was pure gold
" @assjam3104  That is considered hurting you. If they take resources that is harming your body in any way. It doesn't have to cause serious problems for it to be a parasite, it just gets the better end of the deal at your expense."
" no homo  Yes, unless it's the same species in which it is called being pregnant."
Ong ..😂
😟😟😟😓
Everyone looks tired and bored
" Avalanche  no most MRA fights for equality and they want men problems to get solved too, along with the women problems. 
There are many feminist too who are misandrists and just want men hating and also ignores men problems. 
Tag does not matter. 
Your ideas and valid points are the things which matters."

" Avalanche  Why can't we all be equal rights advocates? I believe we should treat every gender equality in profession and when it comes to official things. I'm an equal rights advocate, not an activist. Personally, I am a male who has experiences of unfairness due to my gender and agree with the fact that gender roles based bringing up is flawed so I want to help men in that way but I also have a girlfriend who has her own experiences and I understand women's perspectives through her so I support equal rights."
 @carbon5362  Derick can
 @natalyajones9392  please why is everyone coming at you this is so clearly a joke💀
 @natalyajones9392  parasites always harm its hosts. Symbiote must be you meanning.
 @Foksyful  um no
 @squarecrayon  lol ikr I literally just wanted to make a JOKE
 @natalyajones9392  then you mean that there is a parasite that do not harm its host?
nice pfp lol
 @anthonyrivera3921  that is kind of true men and women shouldn’t be close friends while in relationships because of biological reasons
 @sawruh  Thx 😂
Hahahaha 😂
ikr
He rages me
Ikr

 @sitalvs  yes misandrists are not real feminists.
"What hurts me like, seriously, physically hurts me is that they are other men out there that hold the same views as he does."
And mine
Everybody was!
Literally everyone lol
 Jonathan Cruz69  but he isn’t
 @anonymouspotato1022  that usually indirectly hurts or directly hurts the host*
 @imhachi6500  pregnancy is so painful for women some people die because of it some people die in labor it makes you sick and weak it makes your back hurt it does all that
 @imhachi6500  you strongest argument is the species is the same but they are different forms of a species a fetus and a fully grown person are not the same and just because a parasite generally gives its hosts worse effects doesn’t mean things that effect another thing less than that of most are not parasites
" @anonymouspotato1022   alright well here’s some more.  Since 4 out of 5 didn’t make sense for u. When a parasite invades a host, the host tissue will usually respond by encapsulating the parasite in order to cut it off from other surrounding tissue. In the case of a fetus, the mother’s tissue will create a lining tissue that connects, rather than cuts off contact with other tissues (placenta lining).
Parasites usually elicit a surge of antibodies as an immunological response. With the fetus, however, a mother’s trophoblast (the shell of cells surrounding the embryo) will naturally block these antibodies so as not to reject the fetus. This reaction is only found in the embryo-mother relationship.
A parasite will generally weaken the cellular reproductive capacity of the host.For a fetus, the effect is the opposite.
Parasites generally stay with the host for life, a fetus leaves upon birth.
Parasitical relationships are mostly harmful and unnecessary to the host, generally damaging the host in a variety of ways. A newborn (fetus post-birth) is very healthy for the mother, bringing benefits of an emotional, cognitive and chemical nature.
The most obvious one, a fetus is a human being in development. It will never become anything other than human. Even a first trimester fetus will have fully developed arms, legs, ears, facial features, sex organs and a functioning heart, as well as sufficient neurological development to feel pain. A parasite is not a human and never will be."
 Gabriel Baller  yes
"Same as child get disappointed when you dont buy them too much lolipops. But adult knows too much of it is bad for a child. Only sin of Derrick is that he lacked masculine and stoic frame to support his words and allowed him to get interrupted. 

I mean, lets not lie to ourselves. While the guy is not best speaker, he is on point with everything he said. Whamen are children in adult bodies role playing what their ideologies propose because we men allow it. In nature, male is stronger, and so, female only can do what male allows it. Goes for all mammals really. 

Ofc, I dont expect brainwashed to be able to critically think or know evolutionary psychology, but the moment you try to substitute your personal experience as a fact, you are outta of conversation."
 Gabriel Baller  I know
Our accounts match
" @natalyajones9392  ikr, way he declare wouldn't clear to be understood. Thought of myself need a better comprehension for me to learn on class, as a define practices. I couldn't grasp for what he have said lmaoo"

Lmao right Aleyshas face 💀💀
Natasel Wait whose side are you one here? I am very confused with those words that are on my screen.
Natasel      Do you mean that no matter what side your on it has some wrong faults?
"Natasel sorry but that is irrelevant , not in all arguments one of the side is right , in some argument non of them are wrong so it doesn’t matter , while in some argument both of them are wrong like in this argument both of them had faulty expressions that don’t even represent the least part of the society , they didn’t talk about real problems they talked about irrelevant matters"
Natasel you confusing me lmao.
Natasel wouldn't sides always exist in a 3D world? Thoughts are 3D because we live in a 3D world. Everything has a side.
"Ikr, they looked disgusted by him lol"
Natasel why should we get rid of feminists? They just advocate for women’s rights and gender equality
Lmao
 @bayleylancaster  thank you..they call us man haters..but we are not

 @bayleylancaster  anyways every 13-17 year old girl that calls herself feminist or freedom fighter because it puts some posts in their storys pisses me mad off
 @bayleylancaster  I totally watch fox news from germany
" @Recktorph  say that again but make it make sense this time...

Who would’ve thought that a girl defending herself could make a sexist little boy raging mad 🤦‍♀️"
" @bayleylancaster  oh no i am so sexist
What did i say to be sexist?"
 @bayleylancaster  say that again but use good grammar this time
 @Recktorph  oooooo someone gets all their info from fox news it seems 👀🤦🏾‍♀️
" @Recktorph  lmaoo it should be normal for everyone to be feminists. Ppl who hate men arent feminists, they're just sexist. Idk why you dont get the difference 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️"
 @oka5969  feminism is not really even needed anymore in most countries at least
 @Recktorph  it is. Just bc you dont see inequality towards women doesn't mean it doesn't exist
 @oka5969  just because u see it doesn't mean it exists
 @Recktorph  .......what?

 @hairdresserfrommilanthatst947  Proof it happened?
 @tanaysia6844  i know righttt
"""Go to the past"".......... 🤣💀"
If Feminism wants an equality. Then why when men raped a women the man has to die by Death Penalty. But when women raped men. The woman didn't get to the jail. Because no one will believe you. If you want equality then the woman should die on death penalty too. Salary?? No. When women gets more money than man. Most woman (not all) will leave that man. I remember when someone I know that his wife is a secretary of a company and my friends job is he sells bed. Walking while carrying that bed to the houses. he do that because of his children. But in the end his wife leaves him saying I make more money than you. And she cheated on his husband for a richer guy. Richer than his salary as a secretary. That's hurts so bad. If women wants an equality. Then they should carry heavy items like us. If women wants an equality then they should go to military just like us and etc. When it comes to Women Rights. They have more rights than men. Here in my country. If the man cheated on his wife. The husband will go to jail but the Mistress won't go to jail. If the law are Equal. Then the Mistress should go to jail too. Women don't need equality. Women need Protection and Special Treatment. Geez.
ikr they looked so pissed lmao
The guys look just do “really bruh”
"Pov: you don't know who ""Natasel"" is and what they are talking about 😐"
I feel bad for those women having to be in the same room as him

THEY LITERALLY ALL JUST SIT THERE LIKE 😐 HELPO
He doesn't believe a single word he says!
LITTERALLY

Yesss they look so disgusted and same 🤢
 @m00nj3llyfxsh   projection much you need to grow up and stop playing the victim
None of them were here for it.
"This is pretty immature for someone that seems, well, pretty mature."
Everyone was rational except Derrick 💀
"Derrick did not argue his point well at all, with that being said the the 2 other guys had solid arguments, and notice how emotional the women got vs the men. This is a big reason men are more successful then women in the same field, more logical decision making (men) vs emotional decision making (women)."
Yes 100%
Yes
100000000%
Yea he’s horrible
i agree
10 sextilon procent
I MADE IT 1.2K LIKES!
He’s awful and sexist
Yup 100%
Evezi Omuyeh yep
Bandwagons that read the comment section before forming their own opinion
Pretty much
nah home boy makes some banger vids
Yea pretty much lol
yep
yes
"I found myself wondering if he's actually that awful, or if he was purposely trying to be a troll."
100%😪
Dislike not hate.
Lol they hug and stab each other at the back😂😂😂
How so?
Yet we ignore the ignorance and arrogance of that lady and Aleysha and we just focused on Derrick being a fool
"Kurst and Zach were true gentlemen, very articulated and educated and kept their calm even when the feminists tried to shut them down"
"not really, he's pushing and being aggressive in asking her to pull up a statistic that most people won't have unless intentionally prepared. He used her inability to answer to justify his own point - which is a logical fallacy"
"he was very articulate and well versed in some areas but these people came to have an open minded discussion, nothing really too in depth"
" @rpepero4774  A logical fallacy to come to a debate with research done beforehand? Especially when that is his whole career, studying gender-based discrimination? What would you have him do instead, pretend he knows nothing and argue based solely on emotions and how things should be based on how he feels?
Asking someone to explain an extraneous claim with evidence which you know to be false by virtue of studying it, is not a logical fallacy."
"I thought the same thing! Kursat didn't say much through the debate, but when he did in that one moment, he just got a sarcastic/demeaning reply. Truly a bummer"
 @rpepero4774 Really how was he being aggressive? I thought he was calm and collective. I also think if you are going to a debate then u should kinda bring your facts regardless if they were asked for or not
"​ @rpepero4774 logical fallacy?,did u just learn that word 😂,cuz ur using it wrong,let me guess u just learned it from an AP English class"
 @avocatobigpp4249  forgot which one it was but theres definitely a hole in that line of reasoning
" @rpepero4774  there isn't a fallacy,the middle ground is for deep debates, research is their to back up your argument,your supposed to do your research,they teach you this simple knowledge at school,in debates you bring your own research"
 @rpepero4774  yes but the point of a debate is you intentionally prepare and do you research instead of turning up unknowledgeable and unprepared. In order to make that pint she should have backed it up with a stat too seem logical instead of overly focused on emotional whims.
 @Heejinbunny  he...brought it up in the first place. She has no way of knowing a specific stat to disprove his claim lmao
" @rpepero4774  Yes, you just explained how a debate works. You provide statistical proof to solidify your claim. He asked if there were feminist orgs that have fought for men's equality in the courts, she said ""yes, absolutely"", he asked her to verify her claim, and she could not do so (because there aren't any and what she said was a lie). Sorry he called her out I guess?"
LMAO
Lol true

"Give the feminist the discord moderator powers and Discord becomes a Feminist Cord.

But still, love that joke"
discord mod would win on their own ngl
LMFAOOOO
He seems like a 4channer
Atleast this discord mod had more emotion than discord mods
I'm literally wheezing. Grab me an inhaler.
"2 men's rights activists and a discord moderator 
Vs.
one woman whose blood STILL boils from an unwelcomed advance years ago, one woman who is PROUD to know nothing about biases in the family courts, and one level headed feminist (Bea)"
HE LOOKS IT
Ikr
I'm dying on the floor💀💀💀😂😂
"Thank you for the resume. I’ve never been part of discord community tho, kinda start understanding by seeing the persons pointed out “discord moderator guy”"
If he gets that look before even saying he's an incel I almost can't blame him for being one.
Aleysha was by far the most toxic one in the room
" @billrussell4832  That's a pretty ignorant statement, and I as a straight Male I know as a fact that most women biologically are more open to expressing how they feel subcontiously and sometimes have trouble keeping in their feelings as much as men do. As you heard her say, she has definently had bad expereinces with men in the past and wants justice. I am black too and I have a huge idea of where she's coming from. I am not a men's activist nor am I a feminist, I'm only speaking from a general human perspective. My point is, just because a women's actions can seem childish at times doesn't mean they are because she was definently upset with every right to be upset, for a completely acceptable reason and to not see that makes you ignorant like the dude in the yellow jacket."
 @billrussell4832  Obviously I know about the real childish acting/literally crazy women I see but I can tell she doesn't represent that level of excitement.
"Bryan Salinas 
you spelled Derrick wrong, love."
"Jake the Greatest, I don’t really know weather to dislike or roll my eyes at your comment. Your entire argument is weak, but I get where you are coming from. 
I think you should have listened a bit more before you decided to comment; all of the pro- feminists agreed and stressed the fact that toxic masculinity is something that we needed to get rid of. Wether some women find it attractive was and is irrelevant in their argument, as they were simply stating that we needed to get rid of the mentality that men are not to cry. 
Do not get me or them wrong- there is such a thing as being just plain sensitive/overreacting to stuff, but that does not give society the right to confuse young boys into believing that it is a sin for them to give into their bodies natural mechanism of healing by not crying when they have been physically wounded; or letting the ways of the patriarchal system slow down the lives of the world’s future males. 
Anyway, I recommend you  reevaluate yourself and what you type on the internet. Čau."
"Bill Russell, the fact that your grammar is comparable to that of my 5 year old sister’s, is both childish and pathetic. I find it laughable that you think you can express your views on feminism but, you can not type your comment out in an actual adult like fashion. I said what I said🤷‍♂️."
"Stop, stop he's already dead"
 @bryansalinas5547  and for being in a room with derrick thats saying something lmfao
 @currentlyplayingfair3569  oh
" @currentlyplayingfair3569  facts, slayyy queen💗"
" Jake the Greatest  1st. Who cries over a scrapped knee as an adult? Not women or men. However children should be allowed to cry about their injuries. For most children, the pain they're feeling right then is literally the worst thing they've ever felt. Second, that kind of man is not in romantic novels anymore actually. If you look at the romances in teen novels you can see a wave shift to main male roles who are supportive, non-aggressive, and willing to express themselves. You are right that a weak man is not attractive. However that definition is changing to a man who can not take criticism about his advantages, a man who cannot express himself, a man who needs a woman to be lesser than him to feel comfortable, a man who NEEDS to protect a woman to feel worthy. We don't need that."
" Jake the Greatest  1st. Men should not only be allowed to cry when physically injured. If your dog dies. You can cry. If you had a hard day at work, you an cry. If you've been stressed and suddenly ONE thing goes wrong, you can cry. That's all fine. 


Also I cite teen romance novels because one, they are written by younger women who are experiencing this new wave of redefining manhood into something not hurtful and two because change often goes for the younger generation first. Eventually the adult romance novels will catch up but it will take them longer because of the age of the author.


And I absolutely agree that men and women need to be held to the same moral standard."
" Jake the Greatest  This guy really makes a valid point in this context!  No matter how women want men to be chivalrous and sensitive, men are respected when they're decisive, have mastery over their emotions, strong, and show leadership qualities.   When they're like this and occasionally show an ounce of vulnerability or sensitivity, those rare moments are then tremendously appreciated by Women."
"I noticed in the “men and women should be allies.” It mostly either side saying, your side should be more like blank or do more blank*. Rather I believe it should be as a people we should do *blank or embrace blank or acknowledge blank"
2 men's rights activists and 3 feminists + Derrick
"The comment section:
Feminism: 0%
Men's Actvist: 0%
Derick: 100%"
Men and Women both deserve rights both deserve equal chances in the world.
"15:23 they say how life isn’t all about relationships but when it comes to these topics, look at how the convo naturally steers this way."
the men's rights activist people were also embarrassed by derrick
The way the women are looking at derick when he’s talking is killing me
"The answer its fight for the rights of all humans and make things more fair FOR ALL.

If we keep fighting for one side or another side all the law will be dibalanced in some point."
Round of applause for Zach and Bea great conversation and each genuinely wanted to meet a common ground…. Derrick was well he didn’t belong in this conversation. Wasn’t a big fan of when Kursat was almost belittled by Mimi for doing his “little research” as if having research was a bad thing. Long story short just Zach and Bea should get part 2
I’m surprised they even managed to pull Derrick out of his moms basement
2 men’s rights activists vs. 3 women vs. a science experiment
I love the lightskin girl. She’s so soft spoken but straightforward. She’s so kind but blunt with her points.
It’s like a bad relationship listening to them argue
"25% of the comments: random stuff
75% of comments: everyone vs derrick"
"Nobody:

Derrick lookin like a whole 4th grade boy and then a middle school boy attitude-"
I personally feel like Alicia and Derek were the two ones displaying the most toxic behavior. Alicia saying why do men need an activist movement or rights movement was so incredibly toxic. Everything that Derek said was extremely arrogant and ignorant.
the second he called himself an 'incel' it was all over
Derrick has a higher chance of starting a grease fire with his hair than having a girlfriend
"Oh great! Some people are going to have a great conversation and maybe agree on something!!! 


Derrick has entered the chat."
Mimi is just got caught in a lie. Now she uses her child like behavior to get out of it.
Derrick is his own species
 @yeehaw8835  xD
 Zackyboi Sharp  xD
derrick is for sure a feminist no doubt about it
Average Mo of course they were triggered and emotional from my POV they didn’t lash out or be near to tears but they did it in a calm way. How else are you supposed to have this discussion or any discussion of any topic at that without having some type of reaction. As long as we find a common ground or end goal without having one side having more power then we’ll finally be set.
Average Mo Unless you’re in their spot I don’t think it’s necessary nor fair for you to call them highly emotional. They’ve ben through stuff you can only imagine. God so arrogant
Average Mo The hell? “No Reason” you’re putting it in away like theirs no reason. Their was a reason but you wouldn’t know because you haven’t be in her POV
"Yknow that he could have experienced things 10x worse than her, even worse than you have experienced and you act like there arent other people in the world that are more oppressed than women. I agree with both sides but the feminist side seems to not have lots of factual evidence on issues and most of their claims are from personal experiences, or other people's opinions. Now stop getting so worked up over a topic that shouldnt even exist, but it does due to people being overly sensitive and emotional when the slightest mishap occurs."
 Zackyboi Sharp  im derrick
"Average Mo you’re not a girl, how would you ever know? Do you know how hard it is? I’m used to cry every day because I was bullied at school, and all the men in my life would think I was emotional and just told me to get over it when I just couldn’t and needed help. Until this year, I found my best friends. My father is feeling constantly sad like I was before, and asked why no one had any compassion for him. ( I still love him but still his emotional problems) How about me? How I was 7 years ago, a little girl in need of help. Jesus. You’re biased Average Mo."
" Average Mo  the girls maybe got a little into it,  but like wtf was Derrick even talking about."
Quintin Nelson best tv show ever
"wakandian karol chicken nugget 
I just want to say one thing: this comment doesnt really express hardships for GIRLS because boys/men have the same sadness over bullying"
Sowbi I love when people use XD is 2020. XD
"exactly, its funny how they picked him as one of the people and highlighted a lot of his bigoted views. It was definitely done to dismantle the mens argument which is disgusting"
Lol so true😂
1 gamer
"And then there is Derrick, just Derrick"
Even the MRA was like.
Grace Johnson like how the other two male rights activists acted
" Average Mo  Can you please quote some things that they said that were unnecessary? Not one of those men said anything that debunked a single thing they were saying. Plus the fact that the only thing they even really spoke about was court, which is usually at the hands of other mens decisions. You are what they're talking about, you're the type to tell your son not to cry. Also, another question, why would you have the function to cry if you weren't supposed to cry? The feminists pointed out lots of facts while being understanding of the men when they pointed out unfairness in court, they agreed. Also, studies do show that the reason men have shorter lives IS because of the emotional oppression."
" @majinchris6774  What do you think a man could have gone through at the hands of a woman, that is worse than a woman getting sexually harassed/assaulted by men?"
" @rajeetgupta1833  No, he's an example of how about a third of all ""mens rights activists"" are."
"What do you mean, I loved Derrick. He was like Woody from the Suite Life"
Quintin Nelson yea derick
derrick does not even represent most inscels
 Average Mo  who are you to say that the woman were being highly emotional. They were not being highly emotional they were simply explaining what had happened to them and genuinely asking questions about what had happened to these three men so that they have an experience of there life that would help understand there point of view. You can not say the woman were being highly emotional if the men didn't express themselves at all. Who knows maybe the men are just as emotional and just said nothing about it because like one of the topics said men are always told to man up and show no emotion which is what ends up causing a lot of the toxic masculinity that is sadly a very real thing in our world.
" Average Mo  bro.... The incel side was deffo emotional lol....Not only that but he also stumped himself a couple of times.... The women were definitely emotional also.... What this group was missing, imho, was a jock, that would've been funny."
 @gracejohnson2357  well not like : I didn't do my WESEAWCH oki hihihihihihih but im right lol
Average Mo because their girls what do u expect.
 @katiecheung-lt7ic  wow so men cant have issues worse than girls did u know boys are bullied worse than girls all girls get is talk from people boys get beat and abused daily and also take the talk as well u are biased as well if u act like being bullied is a girls only experience
 @jackbassett3091  probobly worse since girls dont get beat as bad they only get talks even if they get beat it is a  laughable fight when boys go at it they have scares for life
 @redteeth4890  no he is not stop generalizing
Samir Raza no one asked.
" Average Mo  they're ""highly emotional"" because they actually have personal experiences around this. That doesn't mean they lost, that means they actually won because they have seen the proof."
" Average Mo  LMAO because lack of emotion means you're more intelligent, right? Way to be the perfect example of toxic masculinity. You've just confirmed that it does, indeed, exist. 👍"
LMAOOO
 @majinchris6774  and he could have brought it up to make his argument make more sense? 🙄
🤣
😂
 @yeehaw8835  Haha I was the 1000 like!!
Why couldn't they just put someone else there. He ain't anything like an MRA
lmaooo ikr
Derrick is just doing his own stuff there.
 Average Mo  I understand her. U expect a woman to not while talking ab this topic?
Lmao😂
" @michelleflorence1934  I didn't see her on the edge of tears, I just saw her angry

Average Mo But shouldnt you become a feminist based on your personal experiences and not just because you want to....
"There are 118k comments, and about 100k of them are roasting the hell out of Derrick. However, Derrick still has more chromosomes than that"

The jubilee cast of this videO hey woooooah on the greatest channel on the greatest channel in the wooooOooooOooooOrld"
 @katiecheung-lt7ic  I'm not a girl but I have experienced a highly similar situation
" @redteeth4890  when one of the male activist ask for a feminist group that supported inequality for men they couldn't give none. And that same person also brought up the fact that the wage gap isn't a sexist issue. And the legal system is not always up to the male, female play apart of that to. Also even if males were the majority, why do females get lesser for the same crime a man have done?"
 @redteeth4890  a man getting sexually harrassed/assaulted by a female which is possible
 @redteeth4890  1/3 of feminists act just like that
 @inessantos1288  you do not have the right to tell anyone that
" @ringwolf5134  What? Suming up, feminism is a cause that I suport, cause I saw a documentary that really freaked me out. Did u know that women  have a paycheck much tinier that men even doing the same job? Did u know that I am A KID AND I got scared of having Kids cause I din't want to lose my career, in the future? Idk witch of my responses u r talking about but this is how I feel and I am terrified every day of being raped or kidnaped, because that happen, a lot"
Who put him there 😹
" @inessantos1288  A paycheck minuscule in comparison to men's? Can you give me a single accurate document that supports that? Because the ""wage gap"" in any group of people is usually based solely off the averages earned of men and women, which consists of a large variety of jobs. In other words, not the same job and different pay. Because that would be illegal. So even if it were happening, which it is unproven as of now, it would not be a systemic discrimination, merely the discrimination of an individual by another individual.
Your personal fears are of no concern to myself nor of anybody else. If you are delusional enough to believe you would be kidnapped or raped, having it be statistically improbable as it is, you are causing unnecessary stress unto yourself. That can not be used in this debate.
Most employers offer maternity leave should you decide to have a child, but that is entirely up to the company you work under.
I highly suggest you re-evaluate where you learned your values from."
Ring Wolf sorry 🥺
" @thelogicalfallacy4635  Ilegal? No, that would not be ilegal because so many people think that women are not supose to work and it is not just men that think that way. In business, specially in America and rich countries, in business jobs, women and people of color almost always get less pay, there are still countries were women cant drive and cant show there faces, and if you need proof, just google a graphic that shows the pay in 2020. And I am a child, I dont have a job, I just do research and watch documentarys"
"There three genders male, female, and Derrick"
" @samirraza9069   as a male who struggles with chronic depression and anxiety, and watching this video and reading your comment made me think of a book my therapist recommended to me. It focused on depression in men, and a good portion of it focused on toxic masculinity- specifically, how men are trained from a very
young age to be as loud and influential as possible but not express their emotions at all, in contrast to how women were raised from a young age to value emotional connection at the expense of their social expression. The effect of this mindset is
fairly obvious; women by default can express their emotions more freely in society but have less of a voice, while men by default are individualistic social climbers who struggle with interpersonal connection. Hence why a good portion of men,especially successful ones, develop depression and
other mental illnesses, where women struggle to be 'successful' but tend to have strong support groups to lean back on. Honestly, I think both sides (men and women, feminists and men's right activists) need help."
" @Wbb-li2ok  Wow, that's actually an amazing analysis of society. Both men and women have problems, we just have different ones. I'm just not sure if those things are our innate natural leanings or if they're social constructs. If it's in our biology then that would be terrible, however if it's the latter, then we can be glad because we can change this, but for that we all have to openly come together and constantly address it. It's just weird for me to see feminists pretend to care about toxic masculinity and male depression but then make memes about ""male tears"", I think most men and women in society will subconsciously view a crying man as extremely unattractive whether they admit to it or not. It's a shame because those things have to be normalised. I've personally noticed this thing in girls my age, it feels like they're phone addicted and unambitious, maybe because they feel like they don't have a chance to become successful, which seriously sucks because I doubt we can fix the problems of one gender without at least addressing the problems of the other. We can't fix the issue until feminists stop with their toxic femininity and start working with men's rights activists and vice versa. 



Also hey dude I hope you're doing better and that your therapist is a cool one who's helping you out, I can only imagine how tough it is for you so get better king. ❤"
" @inessantos1288  Statistics never show the wages of individual comparable workers, they only show the average income, which is bad because to truly see if there is a gap you need to take a female doctor (for example) with the same experience and qualifications as a male doctor and see if they earn the same or not, and they always do. Average means calculating all the wages together without accounting for nuances. Men on average work longer hours and more dangerous jobs, and they study for the highest paying jobs in University, mainly STEM subjects, which pay more than female dominated fields, more girls want to become nurses or Kindergarten teachers and more boys want to be IT consultants or lawyers or doctors. Lastly, men on average take less days off than women, all those things add up and it becomes more likely for a male coworker, who works longer hours and doesn't go on holidays that often to get a promotion than it is for a female coworker, who doesn't do any of that. The same thing would happen if it were the other way around, if women got payed less, then companies would ONLY hire women so that they can save up on millions of dollars. It's common sense."
" @samirraza9069 Idk man I wouldn't shape all feminists like that, I'm friends with a few of them and they are quite chill. At this point I feel like putting people into boxes don't help either. Honestly, I think both sides need help. Women deserve to have their voices heard and their needs and wants considered just as much as men, AND men need to be able to express themselves on a more personal, intimate level in society without it being disregarded. They're both valid points,and while men feeling bad about their lives isn't as pressing an issue as trans rights or women's reproductive rights on the surface, it becomes a more serious issue when more men start killing themselves, AND their families, or going to public places and shooting wildly into the crowds. The real problematic people to me are the ones that think we have to focus on either men or women exclusively, or even at the cost of the
other, because that's only going to save one side of the bridge while burning the other..and eventually that fire will spread and consume everything anyway. 
What I'm trying to say is  we're all human. We all need help. We all deserve to express ourselves as a full person, inside and out,
and be treated as a person for it. Thanks for the uplifting message i needed it. 😊"
 @gracejohnson2357  the answer is not be trigger or emotional?? what is wrong with you. you do not even know the basics of debates???
" @Wbb-li2ok  Yea you're right, I was referring to the radical feminazis but normal people aren't like that, cause the core belief of love and respect for all is a given and can't be taken for granted. Also I like the bridge analogy, it seems like the more we openly talk about it in public spaces like YouTube comments the more we normalise it and therefore the stigma fades away, it's also the reason why I subbed to Jubilee in the first place. 

Also anytime bro 😊"
yeehaw lmao
3 feminists vs 3 sexists
Derrick is dead btw
Hahahaha
 Average Mo  of course people are emotional when it comes to their rights
Lol for real
" Average Mo  how was she supposed to stay calm? did you even hear what she had to say? she's been through so much, yet you don't even feel an drop of empathy for her."
@Anyssa De Gracia wait fr? Is their an article on this?
" @inessantos1288  Zach put it quite nicely, i think the black girl had some negative trauma with bad men and that in turns led her to judge men as whole in the society. She may need more than the movement, she may need therapy"

Admit it, you got that a+ in gender studies 101"

Well said sir.

TNGN!"
"the thing to see is

derrick is a kid, he has honestly not step foot inside the real world, i know because when i was younger i was him, and than i realized that if i have a disagreeing outlook on feminism, i should look at mens rights activists and see if they fall into the same traps

and low and behold they did

i think both sides ahve there right and wrong points

for feminism, its more about having one villain, one all encompassing bad guy to direct at and that comes from being more about society 

while in comparison, MRAs issues have multiple villains form the courts, to society, to yes even women from time to time 

but really i think they are fighting for the same thing which is why they fall into the same traps that make both toxic"
Lmfao best comment ever
Derrick is a whole different thing

Derrick is a different breed 👽

😂
 Zackyboi Sharp  XD
 @yeehaw8835  XD LETS KEEP IT LIKE THAT!
The only people I like were the dude in the grey T-shirt and the girl in the white top I thought the other 4 were sexist
💀💀💀
" Zackyboi Sharp  - Nope, not a gender. Don't think the trans, non-binary, and other gender-related communities want that either. (I specified them separately because while these communities often overlap, there are people who may consider themselves in one community but not the other.)"
Lol
Derrick is so annoyinf like im barley in the second question but the way he laughed when the girls would step in the middle
 @majinchris6774  fax
 @quintinnelson9364  lol Derrick is a madman
 @rajeetgupta1833  hard
this is the funniest comment I've read today
Facts I feel like I could have a discussion with the two activites even if we dont agree on anything. One is looking at the legal aspect of it and he was speaking facts about biases in the legal system and the other one seemed like he was trying to understand.
Derrick is ......perfection. Nothing more.... nothing less
How is Derrick a feminist? He compared women to babies. Haha
😂😂
Derrick is his own thing
 @avasava7720  totally 💀
"2 mens rights activist, 3 feminist, and a misogynist."
"He appears from this same channel title 
I am an incel, ask me anything
Look it up!"
 @pland4419  What makes them sexist in your opinion
Derek is just a normal guy
"I'm sorry, Derrick did nothing qrong tye entire video, the women said so many wrong fcking things"
AHAHHAHAHAHA
More like 2 Mens activists + 1 true feminist + 2 justice for women girls + Derrick
derrick is a different BREED
hilarious
Derrick is on something else
 Zackyboi Sharp  nah he's his own specie's
No category wants Derrick 😂
"Pshh little do y'all know, Derrick be smashing all three of them ladies on the down low. Smooth mfin Derrick needs to save some for the rest of us."
Facts. Of course they picked the worst guy to represent men.
Nope. Derek is not just a Mens rights activist but he’s THE AVERAGE Mens rights activist
"Like he said, he is an incel activist. 😂"
It's sober derrick
Fr bruh. Everytime he spoke I felt a burning feeling in my stomach bc we should not be letting people like this represent us. Hes basically the inspiration for the Josh guy in she hulk.
Hahahaha my thoughts exactly
 @avasava7720 HENIS AN INCEL
Lol😂
​ @yeehaw8835  too much of andrew tate😂😂
"​ @toniagbaje3218 Sorry but there is no such thing as ""toxic masculinity"""
"​ @JohnSmith-nx2bl No, Derrick is definitely NOT the average 'men's rights activist' by any means."
Derrick is just like that one chill homie :)
😂
Derek androgynous?😅🎉👏
Fr homie weird. 😂

 @goofy2126  are you being sarcastic or do you actually believe that you can be involuntarily celibate
 @Franksinny0tra  You can. Have you've never seen neutered dogs?
" @Franksinny0tra  LOL, what do you think?  Methinks you are way too serious!"
@Jrpg Fanatic I was literally never talking about that either
@Jrpg Fanatic I’m sorry what?
"@Jrpg Fanatic why were you calling him a simp, for what"
@Jrpg Fanatic “feminist simp” never heard that one before
"@Jrpg Fanatic I actually have no idea what you’re saying because the majority of it is grammatically incorrect, but sure “feminist simp”"
 @goofy2126  no. just. no
FACTS
Which feminism is against they don't want equality but triple standards hopefully AI will put an end to their toxic movement by showing people their true colors
" @egg4489  there’s a radical feminist, we don’t claim them. they took feminism to the extremes feminism is actually about giving woman equal rights as men"
 @egg4489  and some men’s rights supporters are too radical. They’re more of degrading women than helping men get rights that they already have. It’s like you see someone in a handicap spot and you feel offended so you go in the  spot and then people are like you don’t need the handicap spot but you don’t get out the handicap spot.
 @egg4489 pov: feminism is 1 tweet with 2 likes. I guarantee you only know feminism from anti feminist sources (I know because I used to think the same).
 @egg4489 How is feminism against it?
agree but feminism now is abt superiority
Exactly: as the first statement said they are different but equal
"All of us men are embarrassed that derrick is himself a ""man"""
" @LanxPenzenpepper  correction: all of us men are embarrassed by anyone that thinks a ""men activist"" is a real thing"
Maybe he didn't learn enough history.
Ryan Moores you are my new favorite person
he was the worst person they could have chosen for this episode lol
 @LanxPenzenpepper  No he is not and he never will be.
Ryan Moores look up the paternal court you wanna pretend men don’t have real issues until it happens to you smdh
" @ryanmoores8170  let them believe what they believe in, doesn't matter it exists or not. You remind me of that women in Pro/Anti Me-too video who said ""False accusations doesn't happen""."
LanxPenzenpepper simo
 @ryanmoores8170  no  . .. men's rights are actual problems lmao they exist
 @ryanmoores8170  Finally someone gets it
 @dragonbullets2763  like?
Ryan Moores agreed
" @aye_papi  i agree with what you're trying to say, but issues like this happen because of the incredibly limiting idea that women should be the only ones raising kids. one of the dudes in the men's rights activist side also said that he believes that men shouldn't raise kids. feminists have been trying to break these gender roles and then they're also the ones who get blamed for it. :("
" @aye_papi  a huge amount of ""men's rights"" problems stem from patriarchy. so you're men's rights argument actually aligns with our feminist one :)). i'm sorry if my english was hard to comprehend, its my 2nd language :))"
"mahima nandani mahima nandani thank you for actually responding and not bashing and your English is wonderful! But I’d have to disagree in the video itself the black woman when asked what she thinks about men’s rights said “I laugh” which shows a lot of feminist opinions on men’s issues etc. 78% of all suicides are men I dare you to define how this is the “patriarchy’s” fault. The list of male issues is EXTENSIVE and most (not all) stem from biases and double standards held by women for example false rape allegations, divorce court settlements, male emotional abuse etc. all stem from these biases. To add on to my last example there are over 2000 abuse shelters for women yet only 1 for men even though it’s a proven fact women commit abuse crimes just as much if not more then men, but the third wave feminist movement has not made any attempts to solve any of these issues nor do I expect them too hence why there is a men’s rights movement to deal with men’s issues. If the feminist movement actually gave two fucks about men we wouldn’t need men’s rights movements but it just flat out doesn’t."
 @ryanmoores8170  I hope you won't see yourself in a family court
"Women want to close gender pay gap working from home or in warm office 9to5 usually less. 
Mean while men lug the bricks, concrete,steel you name it. In high risk areas in freezing or super hot conditions, 12 hours a day. All so that you can close the gap. 
Just because you have a painful labour at your own choice doesn't mean you should be gifted everything. 
Earn your respect, don't expect it."

 @moldycupbleachpower6782  the pay gap is not existent
 @aye_papi  Do men have issues because women are oppresing and objectifying them?
" @mmafox1018  whenever A Boy  or A Guy faces Sexual Abuse , People Always Dismiss this , This is A Problem Cause Women ain’t special when it comes to facing most things Men can Face Sexual Abuse and it’s Sad to see So Called “ Feminist”    Mostly Dismiss this."
 @mackenzie8703  why would you like somebody that doesn’t think men face any problems or abuse?
 @nyxalex8049  I guess so? Sorry I’m nit sure
" @ryanmoores8170  so men’s right activist isn’t a thing? Despite there being many biased things against men, especially the biased in the court system against men?"
 @LanxPenzenpepper  tell me why its not a real thing but yet feminism can be a thing y cant men have one
" @lancegutierrez2621  most ""feminists"" now are hypocrites... And are not real feminists.  A lot of the females i know hates those people too...  It's basically the same... You can be a men or woman rights activist but discrimination is always a no no."
 @LanxPenzenpepper  wait my bad i missed cllicked on your name i was tryna put it on the other guy my bad
 @nyxalex8049  yeah a lot of women do that but people just say it's a joke
 @ryanmoores8170  thank YOU
" @aye_papi  feminism fights for men’s rights and safety as well. So men’s rights just isn’t necessary. The parental court system is lead by the patriarchy that claims that men can’t parent. Feminism fights the patriarchy, which then goes to fight for men’s rights"
" @aye_papi  feminism wants equality for MEN and wommen, just like black lives matter doesn’t mean that white lives does’t matter, the name is just to adress the historical problem. Its not a girls club with a no boys alowed sign"
" @brunamapra  and the democratic republic of North Korea is a democratic republic😐 you can say it’s about whatever tf you want but actions speak louder than words, and third wave feminism looks like it’s about giving special privileges to alphabet community ppl and women while demonizing straight men and masculinity."
" @ryanmoores8170  Oh the irony of your comment..

Does this mean that you don't believe in equality or human rights? 
I feel sorry for you..."
I dont blame them . I would be embarrassed  if i was a man
Yup I feel bad for them I mean everything would have been so much more better and they could've found a more better middle ground than everyone hating Derrick but I do think both sides made some vaid points and some points they tried to understand form like each other's perspective and others just like disregarded 😌 so yah idk I think I'd go with human rights activists more cause like all humans idk
 @ryanmoores8170  feminists isn't a real thing either in my opinion
Same lmaooo
SAMEEE THEY BE LIKE: 👁👄👁
That's what happens when you are raised without a father.
 @UnknownUser-cn3rv  not true!
" @UnknownUser-cn3rv   no, that's what happen when you blame the world for every single one of your problems."
"I've encountered ""conservative"" men's right activists like him before. I think insecurity and constant rejection in combination with his idea of what ""real man"" is - that's a dangerous combination! Constantly failing to own up to what they depict as masculine and a lack of sexual contact (for whatever reasons) is frustrating! And who is to blame? Can't be just bad luck or that they themselves might have to adapt... So it's gotta be women and their emancipation! Because, just like he said ""we were all happier, back when.."" .... Back then, you my friend might have had an easier life! Mainly because it was a women's duty to make it easier - we had practically no rights, not even the right whether or we wanted sex! The husband had needs and it was the wife's duty to tend to him

""The poor guy"" there in the middle, as week am harmless as he might look - actually BECAUSE of that - is the only one that scares me. His ""let's go back to patriarchy"" comes from a deep feeling of entitlement! ""We were all happie?!r""..... NO, men were! Women not so much. But he doesn't care, doesn't even think about that.... THAT'S what makes him dangerous in my eyes!
Ladies: With guys like him: run!!!"
 @UnknownUser-cn3rv  That's actually not true imo. My husband was actually raised by a single mother and he's nothing like that clown. He was taught from an early age that women should be respected and valued and that men and women are equal despite physical differences.
You'd think he'd be used to be looked at like that by women lol
" @vivalachoba  he IS, that's the problem"
i swear to god hes 13 yrs old
" @vivalachoba  Did he learn that men were to be respected and valued too? Cause in our society, except for a few men at the top, the rest of us don't matter much."
 @vivalachoba  Just look at the statistics.  Being raised by a single mother is objectively detrimental to a child's future.  There is no arguing against that.
 @alen_egret5815  Maybe being raised by a single mother encourages the mentality of blaming the world rather than taking responisbility for your own situation.
" @UnknownUser-cn3rv  If I were to be raised by my father I probably wouldn't be alive right now. So no, sometimes it is better to be raised by a single mother"
" @catsarecool2965  Kid's don't choose their fathers, their mothers do.  So if what you are saying is true, why did your mother pick that man to be your father if she is such a great mother?"
" @sarahsongz282  he's right it's not true, but children need to be raised by both genders. Men are more likely to be put in prison while women without fathers are nor likely to be pregnant as a young age"
 @jesxleel  do you have a link to those statistics?
"They be like:
👁👄👁
➖👄➖
👁👄👁"
@You need magnesium. Not hard to tell which statistics are accurate if you know how they were gathered.
"@You need magnesium. If you disagree.  Just go to the nearest prison, and ask the inmates to raise their hands if they were raised without a father.  I am confident you will find the vast majority of them have their hands up."
IKR!! I been looking at them the same way tho lmao
Unknown User 😂he’s was trolling them clearly he’s literally so obvious with his expression of laughter inside but go on bro
"He's lucky he left with his balls intact, I feel like even the other guys disliked him 😅"
IKR I CANT TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY
😂😂😂😂
" @ruby-cc4ds 
LMFAOOOO"
Right lol
 @vivalachoba  men and women are not equal. We are born and built differently.
 @MrDrake390  Ok incel
" @MrDrake390  Oh, so that's what you prefer being called, beta..."
 @UnknownUser-cn3rv  not true at all!
" @kienduong5317  Just saying ""not true"" is not an argument.  Feel free to try again."
" john scimeca  the point is who tf can define what a man is? a man can dress girly or showing emotion a lot, its just the stereotype like yours force them to be one certain type of man, and thats exactly what toxic masculinity is about."
" @UnknownUser-cn3rv  not you make a hypothetical statement:""maybe being raised by single mother encourages child to blame the world for all their problems"" (anything like that). And start automatically believing in it without finding solid proofs in statistics and actual situations. From my experience, not all mothers are great and fathers either, I was raised by both father and mother, but I still grow up emotionally damage, I still like girly thing (I'm a dude) and act girly a lot and I used to blame the world for my problem in a long period of time (which I'm not proud of). The point is that you yourself dont even comprehend the issue that much, basing on your way of expressing opinions (srsly who say ""maybe"" when they're trying to claim something  right?)."
" @kienduong5317  It is well known and very well studied that being raised without a father has severe consequences for the future of the child.  This information is widely available and easy to find.  Giving an anecdote and then claiming I don't comprehend the issue is not an argument.  If you want to provide some actual evidence that being raised without a father is beneficial or just neutral for the child, you are free to do so.  That would certainly be a more compelling argument."
" @UnknownUser-cn3rv  but you used ""maybe"" in your statement and now I'm supposed to believe there are dependable evidences about it? The point is that all the researches you can find on the internet or books cannot include all the situations."
" @UnknownUser-cn3rv  firstly, this is not an argument since you yourself used ""maybe"" and were not sure about the issue in the first place, but now you suddenly have evidence as ""researches"" and asume that I have to believe in them."
" @UnknownUser-cn3rv  in conclusion, the term ""father"" of your is a definitive fallacy, forcing people to believe in one figure of a father while there million, trillion other types that got left out of the picture. Just saying doing something not to be an argument doesn't make you sound more reasonable either, if I say it's not true then prove it, will you? show me the factual evidence, the real life experience one, the psychologist-qualifying one that claims all families around the world or a dominant amount of them without fathers will raise the children to grow up blaming the world for their problems. If you are reasonable then show me, but for now I believe in the difference in people's ways of raising a child, they can be good and bad without considering gender roles (which is a stagnant term and close to sexism)."
 john scimeca  so like you have problem with women trying to be equal and fighting for the emotion and mental health of men?
 john scimeca  i- bye
Ikrr😟😟 and I feel like the men in general
" @MrDrake390  We are equal , but not the same. We both have biological differences, but instead of shaming eachother about them we should learn about eachoters difference and appreciate what they can bring in our society. For example woman are generally more nurturing by nature, that doesn't make them weak and men are generally more to the point by nature and that doesn't make them aggressive. Both of these qualities might be different, but are equally useful and shouldn't be shamed
Men should learn about women's periods and shouldn't shame them about the mood changes this can bring and women should learn about men's receding hairline. That 40% of men experience this and it shouldn't be a big deal"
@pomegranate juice Just because you know some people who were raised without a father and turned out fine doesn't mean being raised without a father is just as good as being raised with a father.  Look up what anecdotal evidence means.
"@pomegranate juice You can call it victim blaming if that makes you feel better, I just call it logic."
"@pomegranate juice I don't care if it's victim blaming because I don't have a problem with victim blaming.  In fact, if somebody is a victim, they should probably ask themselves what decisions led to them being a victim in the first place, so as to avoid making those same decisions in the future.
Accusing someone of victim blaming is not a trump card to win an argument, lol."
"I generally agree to valid arguments of both sides. 
most MRA fights for equality and they want men problems to get solved too, along with the women problems. 
There are many feminist too who are misandrists and just want men hating and also ignores men problems. 
Tag does not matter. 
We should help both genders instead of fighting that who is better or who suffers more, we should for equality and HELP all genders."
Shows women can’t take when someone disagrees with them
 @sarahsongz282  imma try to find it
 @UnknownUser-cn3rv  I think it cuase they was born in poverty not cuase they had no father
 @UnknownUser-cn3rv  bruh what you should never blame the victim the heck?
" @defiant3752  Trying to avoid bad situations is always a good idea and questioning why the victim put themselves in a bad situation is part of that.  If somebody gets raped, they should ask themselves what they could have done to avoid getting raped in order to avoid getting raped in the future.  Duh."
Mgtow 4 life
 @old_yeller4251  can we get a round of applause
Fax. He's a radical outlier of society and his words are inexcusable. Not accurate  representation of the human race.
 @kalidameri4631  hes a different species altogether.... disgusting asf
 @UnknownUser-cn3rv  As if having a mother and father automatically equates success when it is the opposite hence the high divorce rate and declining marriage rates plus family dysfunction.
the women (and sometimes the dudes) were giving him the angry Batman glare like sameeee
 @catsarecool2965  Beta male
Or lack of eye contact ahaha
They’re disgusted 😂
derick: sweating
"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sameee"
 @UnknownUser-cn3rv  nah my father also supports women rights
" @_blank-_  yeah of course you don’t because i don’t know you ,you can’t even make a point"
 @UnknownUser-cn3rv  not true
 @calanthe21  I'm a dude and I agree with what your saying but I agree with one thing he said it's about how it's easier for women to find men than vice versa
omg i agree haha but we have the same name whattt
 @UnknownUser-cn3rv  what
they look sickened by him LMAOOO
 @alen_egret5815  agree
Ikr
We're all looking at Derick that way
 @UnknownUser-cn3rv  true
Honestly if I would have been in that room I would have lost my cool hearing him talk. What a prick!!
"Nah Mango, we're all looking at Derrick like that"
fr
 @UnknownUser-cn3rv  That statistic exists because of poverty. Most single mothers are not financially stable which can lead to absence because they need to go to work and a bunch of other problems that can be harmful to children.
they're like: 🤨
If Feminism wants an equality. Then why when men raped a women the man has to die by Death Penalty. But when women raped men. The woman didn't get to the jail. Because no one will believe you. If you want equality then the woman should die on death penalty too. Salary?? No. When women gets more money than man. Most woman (not all) will leave that man. I remember when someone I know that his wife is a secretary of a company and my friends job is he sells bed. Walking while carrying that bed to the houses. he do that because of his children. But in the end his wife leaves him saying I make more money than you. And she cheated on his husband for a richer guy. Richer than his salary as a secretary. That's hurts so bad. If women wants an equality. Then they should carry heavy items like us. If women wants an equality then they should go to military just like us and etc. When it comes to Women Rights. They have more rights than men. Here in my country. If the man cheated on his wife. The husband will go to jail but the Mistress won't go to jail. If the law are Equal. Then the Mistress should go to jail too. Women don't need equality. Women need Protection and Special Treatment. Geez.

" @UnknownUser-cn3rv  It’s actually possible to raise a child without a father. It’s called self care, focusing on your priorities, and so on and so forth, and learning how to parent yourself."
RIGHT I FEEL SO BAD LMFAOAOAO
" @vivalachoba  men and woman are not equal, the reason why your husband believes that is because he was raise by a single woman. I can tell you how much men and woman are so different but even if i do you wouldn't accept it, so I'll be waisting my time with ignorance."
 @vivalachoba  why you mad lol
And then he's wondering why hasn't got a partner

"Remember, a science expert who is very opinionated and speaks of no evidential case or thing. Derrick isn't a scientist. I'd know cuz I'm a scientist. And because I've actually done studies on this stuff as well. Like even as a guy I disagree with him. I mentioned the fact I'm a guy because of certain feminists who cough cough think all guys are horrible and would never agree on at least one thing they say. cough cough"
Void Astro lol I highly doubt you're a scientist you sound 12 years old

"Exactly, he threw his ass away the moment the word came out of his mouth."
"The problem with the incel community is that there are varied subsections of groups which differ in intensity, and there is not an official treatise of what exactly constitutes the incel philosophy (blackpill).  Their general argument, which is that women are more selective than men for relationships, is a slippery contention because there is minimal evidence for it.  However, they capitalize on events where women carry a certain attitude towards men solely on their appearance, although this is not to say all women behave this way.  What one could surely say is that there has been a major culture change on the viewing towards polygamist sex, when throughout most of modern history, fornication was frowned upon.  Media categorizes relationships to almost be considered as a fashion statement, where strapping, tall muscular men bond with lustrous, curvaceous women.  These unrealistic physical archetypes of what men and women should be leave an entire population subconsciously influenced by such standards.  People become more jealous of sex when all forms of media glorify it to be an amazing thing.  Underrepresented Men in the dating scene, who probably do not meet this media standard of tall and muscular, probably have a much harder time to attract women because psychologically they feel physically inadequate due to cultural standards, leading them to a downward spiral of resentment and low self-esteem.  Some women who are more in preference to physical intimacy than long-term authentic relations, may hanker more towards better-looking men because it makes them feel subconsciously to be of better value.  What makes this premise interesting is that men’s supposed physical standards are more of a congenital nature while women’s are not.  For example, an overweight woman would not be considered attractive by many but such physical drawbacks can most likely be prevented.  On the other hand, a genetically short male cannot change his height, or modify a physically unattractive face because men are not expected to wear make up.  Derrick employs the faulty generalization fallacy when he says that most women are naturally superficial towards looks, but it is by nature that humans tend to trust more better attractive people than less attractive ones.  This may not detract a psychologically sound, although physically ungifted male from wooing females, though it may make things more difficult in a society where we create matches at the click of a button through dating apps.  Men should be more grateful of where their physical gifts lie and not expect to bond with a “movie-quality” female, but women should be more understanding of men who may have below-average looks.  All of this finger-pointing is useless when it comes to reducing the physical prejudices we have in society.  The toxic side of the incel community recognizes some social pitfalls, but quickly generalizes the motives of women.  The hyper sexualization of media and the false advertising of romance, as well as drunken mayhem and party scenes of 20-something year olds, where the most visceral and attractive partygoers have casual sex every weekend and treat it like the time of their life, leaves physically ungifted men infuriated, when their testosterone levels are raging high and their fathers and grandfathers would have already been married.  This is not to say that this culture is necessarily wrong, but we must encourage people to change their outlook of what creates an ideal, physically attractive  man and woman."
" Eggfriend  provide me with an argument.  And then we can debate and maybe, just MAYBE you can change my mind, rather than resorting to name calling."
 @Sergio_Solorio  r/iamverysmart
" @thereisnofinishline5773  say something.  Your response is of little substance.  Prove me wrong.  Go for it, please, I am waiting.  Name calling will indicate that you have lost the battle"
" @clementine6428  I never suggested that women were inferior.  And I never supported all of the brewing beliefs in the incel community.  But I understand the reasoning behind some of their sentiments, however.  As I said, hatred leads to suffering, and there are much more liberating ways to cope with societal failures."
"Sergio Solorio I am simply saying if your group is characterized by a hate for women, no one gives a fuck about a subsection when it all comes together in the limelight.
There’s no paragraph long explanation needed. There’s no understanding or empathizing needed. It’s disgusting."
 @Sergio_Solorio  did you know that there are also sub groups of nazis but we don't talk about that
Oof size: large
It's funny cause he is now married
 @utubetutorialsals  How do you know?
" @utubetutorialsals  yeah, to his hand. 😂"
Who let him out in public 😻
 @utubetutorialsals  Imma pray for her
 @utubetutorialsals  I'm gonna pray for his wife
 @utubetutorialsals  well i hope they don't have kids
f’s in the chat
Damnnnnnnn! 😂
Ha
Who’s Derrick 😂😂😂
LMAOOOO
99 Problemz is she blind and death? How could anyone in the right mind like him
A harsh reality
agreed
The way i WHEEZED
Imma use this in the future
stay mad marissa
 @marce.4277  sheesh I used to have the same pfp
If Feminism wants an equality. Then why when men raped a women the man has to die by Death Penalty. But when women raped men. The woman didn't get to the jail. Because no one will believe you. If you want equality then the woman should die on death penalty too. Salary?? No. When women gets more money than man. Most woman (not all) will leave that man. I remember when someone I know that his wife is a secretary of a company and my friends job is he sells bed. Walking while carrying that bed to the houses. he do that because of his children. But in the end his wife leaves him saying I make more money than you. And she cheated on his husband for a richer guy. Richer than his salary as a secretary. That's hurts so bad. If women wants an equality. Then they should carry heavy items like us. If women wants an equality then they should go to military just like us and etc. When it comes to Women Rights. They have more rights than men. Here in my country. If the man cheated on his wife. The husband will go to jail but the Mistress won't go to jail. If the law are Equal. Then the Mistress should go to jail too. Women don't need equality. Women need Protection and Special Treatment. Geez.
" @marce.4277  Well, it won't be his kids. That's for sure."
HAAAHAHAHAHAA
This comment deserves an award 😭😭
which one?
 @regisglass5464  when she claimed that feminist organisations help men and couldn't name any.
"​ @regisglass5464 , the MRAs didn't say that.

The feminists said that masculinity is toxic."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus, per pretending they didn't, thank you for noticing why MRAs don't help men"
"​ @regisglass5464 , why are you against men having a group to help and address their issues?"
Derrick is that one student that didn’t research for his group presentation
derrick sounds like he’s mocking himself as he talks
I think it would be to bring these guys back to see like more in-depth conversation
"So, I often hear the phrase ""men have a lot of rights that women do not"" and so I'm curious, exactly what rights do men have that women don't? Because I personally can't think of any, but I'd be happy to hear if there are any that I haven't heard of?"
Derick looks like every awkward “I want to be cool” kid in every high school party
You shoulda had a feminist who is a man and a women mens rights activist
I have rarely watched a video that's equal parts infuriating and hilarious at the same time
"1. Just like the Asian person said, we're made differently for different tasks. That's one reason for the wage gap. It's supposed to be better for everyone.

2. What's toxic masculinity? I get that some guys can be too ""manly"" and cause harm, but when it comes to crying, I lean towards the Stoic philosophy. You shouldn't cry over things you can't control. It just leads to disappointment, and yes, crying can make guys seem less attractive. There are stats to back this up.

3. Here, I kind of agree with feminists. I think things are mostly okay now. Some aspects of our culture still show gender differences. Like men usually pay on the first date, hold doors, and women get certain privileges, like being allowed to leave a sinking ship first or getting into a country first when fleeing. 

Overall, my point is, I'm not really sure what feminists are still fighting for. They talk about rights, but they already have them. The wage gap argument has been challenged, and they even have some small privileges that are just part of our Western culture. I don't see them pushing to level out those privileges.

Sorry for long lmao"
Alternate title: Feminsts vs Men’s rights activists vs Derrick
"What I expected to see in the comments: People arguing about rights

What there is: People hating on Derrick"
derrick put that leg up and i knew it's going down 😭😭😭
"Derrick just wants to get a sex partner and a pet, that's why he wanna live in the Middle Ages, honestly I find incel men rly funny"
Watching a discussion that you're not able to take part in is the most frustrating thing ever...
Bro Derrick should never be allowed to go near a woman
In my opinion. We are different but equal. We complement each other differences.
i haven’t seen a single comment that wasn’t about derrick
"""i dont hate women"" he just ""dislikes women"""
"Derrick is definitely a discord mod. He acts, talks and looks like one. Honestly."
i wish this channel would start doing more than one video on topics... sometimes i feel like the people chosen for the talks dont really accurately represent the demographic.
"“Us going back from the past wouldn’t be so bad”
Camera: cuts to the black girl"
beatsbysweat lmfao
Self deprecation is the first tenet of Inceldom.
He’s a good guy has to work on somethings in his life but who doesn’t I can agree with a decent chunk of what he brought to the table
HE IS PERFECTLY ANTICIPATING THESE SELF RIGHTEOUS FEMINIST BELIEFS.
he kinda sounds like he's trolling at some points
😂😂😂
@gruntydatsun low self esteem is the actual first tenent of inceldom. Self deprecation is the practice of that.
The dude sounds like Lex Luther from batman vs superman
FOR REAL 😂😂😂 I was mocking his words at basically the same time as he was also laughing
"I feel like those can only applied in worldwide perspective, imo a better choice of sentences would be ""men have better access to a lot of things than women"". Example of this is the lack of research in menstrual product for example, it was only last year where they finally tested the usage of pad with actual blood instead of water"
" @nasrinnski To be fair, hygiene products are an unfair comparison to make regarding men. Men really don't have the issue of hygiene products."
 @lavans5721   based on what youve stated that means men dont have the issue of hygiene products therefore women do have the issues of hygiene products
" @nasrinnski  not what I'm stating at all. I'm literally saying what I'm saying. Men don't have that issue, because they don't use tampons and other female menstrual products. 

Because they don't use those, it would be unfair to compare the two sexes in that regard."
"@lavans5721  I mean yeah that's the problem. Men as a gender/species have existed as long as women does, yet the research on females body are still lacking in comparison. Does that seems to make sense?"
"I agree with the person above, rights is definitely the wrong word. It’s not about what women generally don’t have, it’s about what women don’t have in comparison for men. For example, up until like the 80-90s (sorry, can’t name the exact time frame!) it wasn’t mandatory to test medical procedures on women. That meant that for example, many drugs that are administered or procedures that are performed are performed in a way that could (and has) harmed women (indirectly for example though a procedure being effective but with side effects or longer healing time than males,…and directly, for example CPR is still pretty much only trained on male models. Kinda weird because chest compressions feel a lot different when being done on a woman)."
"Meg Griffin-esque, if you will"
Exactly like jonah hills roles😂😂
He looks like Vince Chung from American dad
Couldn't describe him better.
Literally my ex
"Most MRA and feminists fights for equality and MRA just want men problems to get solved too, along with the women problems. 
There are many feminist too who are misandrists and just want men hating and ignores men problems and mra are just against them.
Tag does not matter. 
We should help both genders instead of fighting that who is better or who suffers more, we should for equality and HELP all genders. 
I am true feminist and true mra."
Ikr he wants to be an edge lord soooo bad
YES
what would that change
 @triipon_2774  it would show more perspectives
" @triipon_2774  It would show that there are men and women on both sides, and take away the male vs. female aspect.  It also shows a broader perspective. Also, it shows that a person can be an activist for a movement, even when they don't have a person interest and benefit."
Derrick is why feminists exist
Yes! Because there are people like that!
 @triipon_2774  it would change because then we would start treating it like the issue that it is and not treat it like men vs women
" @aarya5121  oh i see, thanks for the insight."
Yeppppooooo
" Tabora  Actually..men don't have the benefit of gender bias either. They are afraid to show their emotions because it will make them less of a man. People still judge men if they enter a field like nursing, cooking, make-up etc as its considered a woman's domain. I have seen my father's role as a parent been downplayed by society in general as a parent even if i need him equally just as I need my mother. But still it's your opinion just look at all the facts."
 Tabora  hey I said it’s ur opinion it’s up to you. I misinterpreted your comment and thought it to be about men’s rights but I completely agree there has always been toxic masculinity and bias towards men and it’s will always be unfair. (Just a side note I’m a girl) 😀
YESSS
 @triipon_2774  it would have gotten
But then people in comments would just say the woman is a boomer and the man is a simp
"A man can’t be a feminist, a men can support the movement but can’t be part of it, the movement is only for women"
This is the first thing that came to my mind❤️
Masculists and woman rights activists
@jorobe and @romaarmy
" @aarya5121  If you dont mind I would like to make a small correction on behalf of most men to part of what you just said. Men who hide there emotions dont do it because they are afraid it will make them less of a man. They do it because they know a lot of people will TREAT them as being less than they are. i am a man who has never been afraid to show his emotions. I have cried at weddings and shouted I LOVE YOU in the middle of my countries capitol. Now I am a very secure man so I am able to do this but I will tell you this, the looks of actual DISSAPOINTMENT I have seen in peoples faces when I do these things is ridiculous. I can shrug it off but most men simply cannot do that and that will never change. Now you are very correct in what you say about men who enter jobs that are deemed ""womens domain"". They get ridiculed.  Women also often come under the same fire when they enter male dominated jobs like mechanics and building.  Both of these situations need to change and I believe they will over time. what I fear is that the push by both sexes to make it happen NOW! is just making it worse. We need a call for change but is needs to be a tempered discussion, not a screaming match."
 @tigerlily7279  Omg Im sorry but HELL NO. Feminism is not about equality for both sexes. Feminism is by its very definition about empowering women to be equal to that of men. No feminist is fighting for the rights of men. I will speak on behalf of all men when I say we do not want any Feminist to fight for us because if a feminist is fighting for us it means that we cannot fight for ourselves which means we are not equal to women. That is a bloody vicious circle that none of us should ever want to get into.
" @triipon_2774  Besides showing that each side is not a gendered opinion, it would help make the discussion less confrontational.  This group overall did a fair job of remaining civil, but most discussion like this become searching for misstated moments.  You can sometimes see it happen in comments sections.  Certain opinions or comments are accepted more easily when a woman says it because people bristle when a man says it.  Even if it's something simple.  Like I recall one thing where women attacked a guy that said he had a wife and two daughters.  He was commenting on how he helps make sure they don't run out of of tampons.  Apparently, basic inventory management is a gendered issue just because the inventory is a box of tampons.  But had a woman said she uses the same methodology to make sure she never runs out, she probably would be praised for her ingenuity."
wait that’s such a good idea
that would’ve been great but majority of women who are men’s activist i have seen are just huge pick me girls and make men’s activism seems like a hate group against women when in reality it is not
" @tigerlily7279  not 3rd wave feminism. I have no problem with actual feminism, but I do have one with women pretending to be feminists who just want special privileges and attention."
 @ripcurlinbofa  thanks
 @triipon_2774  I think it would help the other side each understand it’s not only men and women against each other fighting for what they both believe are rights.
I'm one of those.
 @malenaabdul664  doesn’t that make the movement... unequal? If feminist are trying to push for equality not “allowing” a man to be a feminist would now make it unequal and seems like the agenda is for something else.
 @tinymoron675  which one?
"Yeah, I’m all for equal rights because there are hella problems on both sides that can really go together"
 @cormac8276  oh lol I forgot to specify. I’m a male feminist
 @tinymoron675  cool
 @aarya5121  that’s exactly why we gotta dismantle toxic masculinity and typical gender roles - so there isn’t this destructive social capital to stand for that literally means nothing to society other than ignorance.
i agree 100%
woman have equal rights already lmaooo
" @urmum9999  they do legally, if you don’t count attempting to politicise abortion. but it’s about when they didn’t have rights and how their representation developed from oppressive patriarchy. law doesn’t represent everything does it?"
Ikr
"modern feminism​ it self is very matriachal, misandry and has already lost it ways. modern feminist​ will always fight to defend their ideology​ from influence​ of men's perspective and play gender politic. what they are is oppsite of what they preach. there is nothing gender​ equal​ about it. its oppress​ive matriachal​ movement. their action say it all"
 @padthaispicychicken2143  i think u got the wrong idea my guy and that says a lot about the patriarchy we live in. understand your privilege and at least try to empathise.
 @LuZu_  says the privileged gender from matriachal​ movement. thats dont sympathize men's perspective​. thats just rich
" @padthaispicychicken2143  i’m struggling to understand what you’re saying but, im assuming you’re trying to deny that privilege exists and to that i say, look around you and look at history - acknowledge that males have significantly more social dominance, acceptance and comfortability than females and when they don’t, that stems from their inability to ignore toxic male standards and as a result become subjected to the repression that toxic masculinity normalises. ‘i’m hard, i don’t care about feelings’ *gets depressed and wonders why male suicide rate is highest in men*. if you start to understand the fragility of most societal norms, you’ll gain a sense of self rather than conformity."
That would be suvch an interesting variant switch it around a bit YASS
Hey just replying because this is a subject I would wanna learn more about I was wondering if you have a link or website I can be reffered to when it came to the statics about crying may make a men less attractive?
Agreed 😀
It’s Karen vs kyle
heyyy I'm a bisexual too
LMAO
Wait I don't feel like looking Wich one is Derrick again?
" @insertnamehere9558  I found out the yellow guy, should've been more obvious he's a little bit of a d bag."
 @MrMonkeMan141  yep
Make this the title please
FACTS!
Feminism vs Men's Rights vs Misogyny. Damn that actually pretty interesting
Literally
Lmaoo.
Feminists communicating with men’s rights activists while they all hope Derrick leaves early
Agreed! Oh that Derek! He made this whole thing even more interesting.
"But that means we are degrading the fact that Derrick is a men's activist. Because Derrick agreed with the other men's rights activists, meaning he isn't versing them. The other men's activists were terrible too... Maybe we should say ""Alternative title: Feminists vs Derrick and Men's rights activists"""
Yes
FACTS!!!
this made me laugh
Derek didn’t argue with the men’s rig  jt d
"+Derrick  he's definitely on the side of men's activists, but he's not supporting th e group very well"
 @haha5368 That’s hilarious 🤣 😂 you should be a comedian.
 @Sam-is6xb  Wdym karen?
"No one likes Derrek, when I first saw him I knew... I knew I was gonna hate him, and here we are."
"Derrick was a bad representative for people who hold a legitimate traditionalist viewpoint of what can be summarized as “gender norms”. Women (NOT ALL NOT ALL NOT ALL) are caretakers by nature. Men (NOTTTT ALLLL) are protectors and providers by nature. These roles are literally built into us - down to our bones. He is bad at articulating the argument for traditional gender norms.

There is a perfectly legitimate argument to be made and data to back up the claim that women as a whole were more fulfilled when the societal expectation was for them to be homemakers."
Derrick was definitely going against the grain.
Yea
"I saw Derrick and I just hated him
I'd I just saw him and it was hatred at 1st sight"
Coz he’s saying the truth?
Derrick a warrior. He makes no sense but fights on
Agreed
My name is derrick and it's exactly spelt like that I've never met someone with the name derrick spelt like derrick in real life before unfortunately
"David Hernandez Eh, I don’t blame em. Some people are just not the likable type cough Derick."
"I think both Derrick and Mimi need to check their attitudes. All the other four were people who you would like to have a conversation with, especially Bea and Zach. But Derrick's idiocy and Mimi's blind faith put them on the top of my 'Stay away from' list"
Ikr I love it 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
Derrick isnt that bad
 @SDLXVI  said no one Ever... 😂
"""I'm an incel"" yeah, that's gonna be a no from me"
SkittleBlitz yeah really weird. He is definitely a minority tho
 @oddlynot6653   i dont think that he is just not likable some people dont agree with what he believes is true.
" @SDLXVI  you sure
just messing i did not agree with him but he probably is a cool person"
Yeah they’re hating on him because every sentence he speaks makes me sick
 @marnenotmarnie259  yeah i did not agree with him either like whats wrong with being Friends with a girl.
The one thing we can unite against 😅
@SkittleBlitz Have you seen the middle east?
"The enemy of my enemy is my alley, right? 

We are all anti Derrick 

Maybe this is what will
Bring world peace."
SAME I THOUGHT THAT TO
based Derrick
i wanted to shout at my screen so many times
Same
"Great way to practice listening, but I agree!!!"
@pawtatuh e3e Some of the women were annoying as well. I don't need you to protect me. Why scream that? The guy was making a very different point
 @eagle3676   big brain jk I agree with you
"I was giving my opinion, not that they heard tho 😔"
 @claudiabenedito2928  hahahaha why??
" @eagle3676  It came off as condenscending when he said it, i can understand why she'd get a little heated"
"The topic is interesting, but im still left feeling nothing was really discussed or bounced back and forth in this one. Im not an activist. Theres bound to be feminists who are too extreme and mens right activists are then going to find their extreme to counter act. Im down for each progressing appropriately. If i were one of those men in this vid, I would have for sure spoken up to ask if the girl really said guys shouldnt joke, and i wouldve tested the yellow sweater guy on his strong opinions repping men as well"
 @pinkpowercoin3341  it came off as condescending not because it was but because there is already a bias there. It wasn't condescending from a third person perspective. Having your mind made up already does that to people
"@pawtatuh e3e some of his statements were troubling like his belief that tradition=better but for the most part, most of them were at the same annoying level as Derrick. I feel the guy in the grey shirt was the best of the bunch"
Exactly
"@pawtatuh e3e Doesn't matter if you said it or not, Eagle 367 was just stating their opinion."
Gosh mood! I wish I could explain toxic masculinity in that room because I don’t think anyone explained it articulately enough to break hostility and preconceived ideas about it
@pawtatuh e3e derricks statements where some of the most truthful ones.If it werent for my looks I'd be an incel just like him. Truth hurts and isnt pretty kid. grow up
Fr
I want to stand up and start talking :/
I yelled at the screen multiple times
"Claudia Sofia at the guys, feminists or derrick?"
" @eagle3676  his point of view is that men should control women he then procedeed to say that women doest have all the rights like kids shouldnt have all the rights therefore yes "" we dont need your protection women arent child im an adult i dont need laws ( standars, regulation, culture, whatever) to protect me or putting me aside as the ones for achild ... """
 @JasmineZegirl  And I don't agree with any of that. But to pretend his was the only troublesome view is just wrong.
Dominic Ornelas I end up screaming and yelling at the screen
 @eagle3676  /yes/. She is literally why I don't like saying I'm a feminist anymore.
That's what comments are for.
" @eagle3676    Derrick compared women to children and that they should be protect like children, so her answer that she doesn't need protection because shes not a kid but a grown adult is quite relevant."
" @Feybred   This whole comment section is about how women shouldn't generalize men activists because of derrick, but you're out here generalizing feminists. And just to let you know, there are Male feminists."
" @Feybred  here's the thing, just because you're living in a perfect world from a first world country (I'm guessing),this doesn't mean it's not happening in other places, you're not the only country in the world, there's other  countries and other places where women aren't allowed to get an education, aren't allowed to work, aren't allowed to dress they want to, and are told that its normal for them to be abused sexually and physically. This is what feminists are fighting for."
" @Feybred  Aren you implying that women are the only gender being protected by the government? I don't know where you're living, but I can tell you that from where I am, if a women harms a man, she will suffer the consequences, and vise versa."
 @narjasalbahrani8123  I think you are conflating 2 situations into one as far as I remember this video.
Missing Legs omg someone gets it!
Feybred you only hear the bad stuff I think feminists are trying to put peace on men’s hearts to make them feel less stressed out it is proven that men live shorter life’s so you can’t say anything about that and there are places around the world that show men are more value then women example men choose the wife and it could be an old crusty men like don’t you think that ?
" @Feybred   Half of the things you brought up in your comments have nothing to do with my comments but okay. You are putting me in a category with radical leftists and then you are bringing forth arguments against these radical leftists. 'label someone as Racist/Sexist/Bigot/hateful and other buzz words(what you did)' when did I do that? I said that it seems to me as though you're jumping on a hate train (which usually automatically refuses to acknowledge possibly accurate points of the opposing side.) I wouldn't put myself on the left or the right this is just my opinion. I am simply for equality and I hate the fact that men and women always seem to be in conflict. I don't support radical third wave feminists 100%, neither do I support the other side 100%. I also dislike it when people jump on either side of the 'train' lol. Because this does in some form show that own opinions on this topic can't be formed. I'm just asking to maybe see the good and bad in both."
Missing Legs YES EXACTLY
Claudia Sofia I did shout at my screen... for the entire video lol
That is true
Missing Legs it really is!
Yesssss
 @DominicOrnelas  Boom!
Lol true
"My poor husband (who is a wonderful man and took my side every time) had to listen to me yell about it at him. He's like ""I'm a white, english, man I don't need more rights, I need to be taken down a peg."" 😂"
yes
" @Hextin  not trying to be rude but derrick said things like ""men arent getting hired at because they're men"" and that may be true in some cases but in almost all cases is exactly what women have been having to deal with, especially going up for jobs in things like construction, mechanics, or many manual labour jobs that include heavy lifting, especially going up against a man.


I know that that is a real problem for women because I know women such as my cousin, who is working towards being a sparky, gets pushed back in her career because the company believes that there are men that will do it better just from the fact that they're a man."
" J P  I understand that he didn't yell his views and said them in a very proper manner but the fact that pawtatuh e3e couldn't handle it because they're a snowflake"" is such a wrong and inappropriate comeback to a comment that wasn't particularly rude or aggressive. they, as you put it ""can't handle it"" because most of the things derrick said and stated was wrong and quite sexist, even if he wasn't trying to be or said it nicely and was ""[giving] his view"""
Facts
Thats what comments are for bby
Especially if most of the points presented are ridiculous...
" @claudiabenedito2928  I didn't want too, I did."
Dude the amount of times I wanted to respond is insane
HONESTLY! i was yelling at my laptop bc derrick or whatever tf his name is kept pissing me off
Haha Yh
This video raised my blood pressure. I felt hella anxious the whole time.
This black lady is way crazier than Derrick.
Was saying!
Rt
"No, watching people discuss something which requires a lifetime to understand and various relationships with different people while having very little requisite experience is the frustrating thing."
I’m so heated!!!
"If i heard ""When i hear 'Mans Rights' i laugh"" from Alyesha i would ruin her day."
Especially when people like Derrick get to be there.
"Both sides say things that make me want to tell them off for. 


How do they think men are less privileged? There are clear aspects of society where men are socially privileged. Look no further than the movie industry 

How does the one lady think tampons should be free? Can toilet paper be free too please!"
U said it
I was literally screaming
Then you tell your self you need to stop watching it but you didn’t yourself continuing on watching
I’m literally responding like I’m there and I would do so well in these vids
 @eagle3676  She was really aggressive when she said that too...like you can be assertive without being aggressive ya know smh
I literally had to pause the video a few times to just break down some of the things I was hearing to logical terms.
Omg I KNOW RIGHT!!!! 😂😂
Missing Legs it is
YES
Actually I had some many inputs that I wanted to click of but wanted to see the end
@pawtatuh e3e the other two men's rights activists probably even wanted to
Ik
 @eagle3676  ikr
u just read my mind
"I wanted to partake in the discussion so bad omg, I don't consider myself a feminist on the modern sense so I would've agreed with Zach in some points"
Missing Legs Exactly and on some other ones when people on my side don’t know what to say and I want to yell to them
I literally paused the video multiple times and just responded in my head for a minute. So YES
"I've been reading a lot of these comments and let me just say that: there are ones I do and do not agree with. There are some statements about how opinions were delivered that were commented by people with opinions I disagree with that I could understand. There are also ones I completely agree with, but many of them would end with mindless insults like ""you snowflakes"" ""feminists are r*tards"" or ""simp"". That invalidates your comment to me and I just wanted to say it makes your opinion seem less educated when it's not presented calmly in my eyes."
i was yelling at the screen
"Missing Legs.  Amen !!! Frustrating is Not the Word !!! Totally agree with you.  This topic is such a hot topic for me.  No shade thrown at any of the people from either side, but I wish I could have been there as well as a couple more people that have slightly different perspectives. For example, a woman that does not believe in toxic masculinity. In addition, a man that wants to see men that are not so positive taking responsibility for their wrongs. I think that would have made this episode more productive and I feel everyone would have stood a better chance of walking away learning something or feeling a little more at peace. Respectfully, the way they had it set up in terms of such limited points of view doomed the chance of any type a progress from the start.  Just my two cents. Blessings to All. Nita NYC."
Derrick?
Hahahaha! I was actually talking to the screen and getting frustrated because I couldn't give my arguments to the people in the video Hahaha!
Missing Legs  I know I want to scream but I can’t because I’m supposed to be sleeping and my dad will hear. So I just have to remain calm. Especially when Derrick speaks.
@Eagle 367  yeah i was thinking that although I am more on the feminist side and even I thought why is she saying that?
 @eagle3676  where was she screaming lol
YES
I just wanted to shout at my screen
Tell me about it.
"had something like this in school for one of my classes, the teacher called it fishbowl. names were drawn and given a scenario or topic to talk about while the rest of the class listened"
Broo i wanted to put my unwanted opinion in there so many times
Like I love how men have to play the defensive the entire time.  It's like the feminists were making the rules to what masculinity should be based on their biased perspective.  The guys didn't question toxic femininity which definitelty can influence men to act the way they do sometimes.  Theres fuckin blame on both sides.  No ones better than the other.
I know I swear I wanted to scream every 2 minutes
Ikr
" @eagle3676  I didnt see that as yelling in the slightest. And if that one moment on the womans side was seen as annoying, then that really doesn't qualify. What he said and A LOT of the things he said were triggering. Her response was justified tbh."
I know right😂
Agreed..
Yes you can. The comments :)
"The girl who said""i dont need you to protect me"" is the type of girl when you offer her a drink she would say ""what you think I can't buy myself a drink?"""
Missing Legs IT ISSSSS I STARTED JUMPING UP AND DOWNNNN
Eagle 367 she wasn’t screaming it tho
Word yo omg
too true
ikr
‼️‼️
Yeah. I have strong views on this subject and I’m adding things in my head. This has also been very eye-opening and helpful.
"Missing Legs 
THIS 🙌🏼"
 J P  How are his statements right? Besides from men and women being biologically different because everyone knows that?
I had to keep pausing the video because I was so pissed
 @claudiabenedito2928  gurl i was shouting! doesn't matter if anyone hears it! im a feminist and this was so annoying.
" @narjasalbahrani8123  in America men receive much harsher punishments than women do for the exact same crime, so women are protected by the government, plus there are so many female privileges that the fact people say women are oppressed is actually insane to me"
"LOWKEYYYY 
I literally ended up yelling at the screen in frustration"
Missing Legs this is the most relatable thing I have ever seen
Eagle 367 ... i mean comparing grown woman to children is horrible
 @claudiabenedito2928  EXACTLY
Missing Legs facts
"Women are brave,strong, and are willing to fight for their rights . women are just as tough as men. Women could beat a man up, women are tough, women can do anything they put their mind to, and women can work dangerous jobs and do dangerous things, not just men. All people who disagree: have u ever heard of  emma Watson or the character Hermione Granger"
Yeah I know those feminists were crazy
 @claudiabenedito2928  woman moment
 @claudiabenedito2928  just shows women are more aggressive.
Missing Legs FAXXXXXX
Missing Legs I had to pause this to tell myself my own say in the question too many times 😂
so true
I swearrrrrr!!! I was just sitting here yelling at the screen. 💀😂😂
Missing Legs i literally kept talking to my screen constantly
I just- I’m- you have explained EVERYTHING I’m thinking right now...
"@pawtatuh e3e he never said you didn't think those fenemists were annoying too, chill bruv."
" @pinkpowercoin3341  In a convo like this with a calm environment you shouldn't get heated but should listen, these fenemists need to get out of their safe spaces more often lol."
" @Shoulderpads-mcgee  There's no such thing as ""toxic masculinity"", only toxic guys. What I don't like about this term is that it groups together men not able to be emotional and them catcalling, somehow making men both the victims and the predators."
18:09
 @eagle3676  everybody was annoying 😂
I know right to. Actually I see some comments from men and I think we might have a healthy talk they r willing to listen unlike derrick
Great  lol
IKR it makes you so desperate
Such facts.
" @eagle3676  yeah and the avarage man is stronger and proof they need men is she was literally talking about how a man was touching her until HE SAW HER MAN, she would have kept getting touched if he wasnt there. Woman and men are made for each other,not to be lonewolfes that are equal in every way, men need woman and woman need men, That's just the way it is"
" @pinkpowercoin3341  If you assume intent, anything can sound condescending."
I KNOW! I paused the video at least ten times to stop and start talking about my opinion and views on this. This is a topic I am very passionate about and would LOVE to have an open discussion about this in real life
Eagle 367 nah I actually agree with u
Missing Legs I KNOW RIGHT!!!!
@pawtatuh e3e No
 @Acore-ly9qx  are you saying women need men to not get sexually abused? Tf?
@pawtatuh e3e literally a king
I wanted to throw my phone at the wall every time Derrick opened his mouth
Missing Legs ikr.
FACTS
This
"pawtatuh e3e Ight mate she did explain but then she went overboard and tried to turn it into essentially a “boohoo I personally got hurt over this and that” like the discussion is general discussion about their respective movements. It was meant to be a equal exchange of ideas but the women in the actual video seemed to have no interest of listening to the males opinions which is sad because kurosat and the Asian dude had actual useful input if they could speak. They we’re trying to go of facts and not opinion and whenever the females made a point or they had input in the injustices females faced they listen. This video is pitiful tbh as it seems like Derrick was just there to discredit the males rights movement, along with that the females kept didn’t even stick to what they “believe in” as they didn’t even give the males face value for there opinions and instead tried to make them listen to there opinion. Like dude I don’t see how anyone see there points as valid even as it’s them giving an opinion on even male based topics despite them saying males shouldn’t have an opinion on female topics."
"pawtatuh e3e You don’t support equality my dude, you support supremacy. The two males in the video seemed to have even more logic two they’re statements then the other four combined. They brought FACTS whist the other four brought OPINIONS, factual intake is more relevant to opinions as there’s a lack of falsehood to them."
"Eagle 367 I don’t think she should’ve come at him, but he essentially said that women are comparable to children and society protects and takes care of children, insinuating that that is what should happen to women and it is men’s roles to do so. She turned it into a personal argument, but she was essentially expressing the counterpoint that women don’t need to be protected or taken care of by men, and that men’s rights activists should not justify their cause using the belief that they are caring for women."
"You feel that you have a point to make and try to show a honesty side to your point while also
Being understanding for the other side too, frustrating but also, at least for me take a step back 
And scince i am not a part of the active conversation and can really process what they are saying."
dude i literally had to pause and say something to my laptop
PREACH!!
 @claudiabenedito2928  Thank god you were behind the screen.
"I know right I'm just sitting there like, NO WAIT, shoooot, Finally!"
TRUE i literally would pause and say my opinion and then remember that they can’t hear me 😂
Very Trusfrating
"Ain't that the truth. Especially when it came to wage gap and toxic masculinity. In my 28 years of life, I have never heard an adult guardian tell their son to not show emotion. You know who I do hear it from quite often though, especially since I joined the military? Women. Women are the ones telling men to ""stop being pussies and toughen up"". Then when it came to the question about women having more chances in society, one thing I would've brought up is how there are more college grants and employment opportunities provided for women than there are for men. There are more outlets and help for women than there are for men.

And honestly, if you're a feminist and you truly believe in the definition for feminism, yet you get angered or shake your head at 'Men's Right Activism', you're disproving that feminism is for equality."
" @caelan8061  Let's swing that around though. Personally, I've tried to get jobs at daycares, admin. offices, front desk clerk, jobs that you normally see women in. I'm none of those things because people see those as jobs women should have, and those are jobs that women typically seek and apply for. Hell, even with the daycare one there are women who would refuse to put their kids at a daycare because a man works there. Why don't I see feminists talking about this?

As far as manual labor jobs, the reason why you don't see women there is because women don't apply for those jobs, or go to college for those jobs. For instance, I used to work for a landscape company and we needed workers. I knew a few women that needed jobs, especially in the summer between semesters, and I told them about it. ""Eeehhhh I don't know"" is the reaction I got. However, I've also worked at power plants and warehouses that had plenty of women workers, but those women really wanted those jobs and worked for it instead of playing the ""I'm a woman so I won't have a chance of getting hired"" card.

Finally, I too know of someone that tried to get into a trade. My mother got her HVAC certificate in her mid 40s and couldn't find a job. She blamed it on her being a women, like you are, and honestly I agree with it. However, not for the same reason. The areas near us aren't exactly safe, even for men. A woman being at a jobsite at a strangers house, by herself, in her 40s, is dangerous. From a company standpoint, if something happened to her on a job, it could cause a ton of problems for the company and family, and from a personal standpoint I'm kinda glad no one hired her because of the possibility of something happening. No matter how much people want to deny it, women and men are built differently, and it's something criminals know as well. A bigger 40 year old man is more of a threat than a skinny 40 year old woman, thus making the latter more of a target."
i was literally talking to myself...
 @JasmineZegirl  interesting fact..women do need protection
 @narjasalbahrani8123  yes women need protection just like a child
 @Acore-ly9qx  well said
 @The_Real_Frisbee  valid points
I yelled at my screen
Feltike throwing my phone at the uncle worm
On the first question i would’ve just said why are you a feminist if you think you’re equal?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
The channel is very well balanced.        Excellent choice!
Ikr
Claudia Sofia i have shouted at my screen 😌
fr not being able to influence this is eating away at me rn i need to like write a letter or some 💀
EXACTLY!
" @eagle3676  
Yeah. Definitely sometimes"
YES YES THIS RIGHT HERE
Right!
Seriously!!! I have NEVER experienced this level of anxiety while watching any video in my life!!!
True
I flipped off the screen SOOOOOO many times!!!!!!
Eagle 367 cos derrick wasn’t even being respectful
Exactly!
PinkPowerCoin yeah I feel you.
J P did you really use snowflake un-ironically?
sameeee
So true...
IKRRR
i literally kept pausing it so that i could scream my points at Derek
I would be so surprised at how wrong Derrick is that I wouldn't even be able to say anything
Eagle 367 he basically said women are like children wtf do you not see wrong with that he’s saying men need to protect women and from who oh they need to protect women from other men BOY BYE
"Lol, this has 36k likes... That's actually not something I see on YouTube every day... Guess it's because people from both sides can agree on this"
"and then I enter any popular music video ever, and see 20 comments all saying ""wHo'S wAtChInG iN 2020????"" with 50k likes each and it puts me back on earth"
LMAOOO
Lol
But also unbelievably addicting
Yessssss
Yessss so frustrating
Facts
So true!
 @eagle3676  he was literally comparing woman with children and says that women aren't strong enough
Especially when that discussion continues into your head for days... It becomes a lot frustrating.
BRO ON GOD
Yes but I couldn’t be calm . I would just be yelling the whole time .
"You shouldn't be apart of a discussion if you feel that way, because you can't sit and listen if you feel that way"
This! I really wanna participate :)
"Yeah, but I was still talking the whole time like they could hear me😂"
I'd blow up as soon as the wage gap was mentioned
"Jesus Delgado honestly, if females are more traditional I would head toward more feminist, but I feel I will get less recognition of having a sign of weakness, I feel a lot of girls don’t like emotional guys except feminist which I feel is a small organization, I still share some of derrick thoughts, but I value females views of the unfairness that’s going on and need to change which puts me in a isolated position as you"
Missing Legs LMAOOO EXACTLY
Eagle 367 nahhh I was also annoyed
 @claudiabenedito2928  okay karen
yes
"I argument with them, my family thinks I'm crazy because I'm talking alone but I CAN'T KEEP THE ARGUMENT IN MY HEAD"
I shouted and screamed at the tv multiple times
SAME
For real my blood was really boiling at some statements
lol i literally disliked the whole video because of this
I PAUSE THE WHOLE VIDEO TO SAY MY OPINION AND YELL AT DERICK
I was wanting to yell at both sides so many times
Pretty much
True.
@pawtatuh e3e kursat and Zach were friendly like the whole time or at least cordial.
 @DominicOrnelas  what are you a middle school or 5th grade teacher that has the worst students
True ! I really wanna give my opinion too uwu
@pawtatuh e3e True tho-
I KNOW....
 Jaydea S  stop what?
True
"@pawtatuh e3e Derrick was so sexist against women, but the black women did seem kinda sjw"
 @JasmineZegirl  No he compared women and children because most woman get off pretty easily depending on what they do
Missing Legs yep
 @Hextin  oml
THAT'S WHY I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO MYSELF AND PUTTING DERRICK IN HIS PLACE
"Yeah, I love watching these kinds of videos but it’s so frustrating"
That's what comments are for. You have an audience we can talk about it here.
"my God, exacly"
 @eagle3676  she HAD to DO it-🤡
 @claudiabenedito2928  fr
True god im pissed.
I stand up for women's rights.
debater's worst nightmare
Yes
Agreed
Yeah for real
"I'm just sitting here completely puzzled to how Derrock even managed to get a seat on this episode. Dont they screen their guests? Like everyone on the floor had excellent points, for the most part. But then the camera points at Derrick and everytime I just buried my face like ""oh God, dude wtf"""
For real
I would have destroyed Derrick and dismantled most of the feminist arguments
Factss
Im screaming at my screen
Yeah. I feel the same.
"LOL i dont have a problem with the whole idea of feminism, i have a problem when the new wave of philosophy tries or attempts to be superior to us men by belittling their male counterpart."
@pawtatuh e3e I agree with everything you are saying but can you explain your analogy of a guy buying his girlfriend tampons to sexist ideology that is very confusing to me.
I know! Every time Derrick says anything I’m like dude wtf
I lost count of the times I wanted to slap Derrick or the women.
Too true...
Me toooo i wanted To jump on the screen when they said that women have more right now
I talked to my screen like they could hear me like 10 times 😂
Not for me i suck at these sort of conversation
 @Louisef22  tbh same but it's driving me crazy that I can't voice my opinions on the topic..
RIGHT
me screaming while in class 😭
" Luís Andrade  It's really funny actually, there's no mention of which side I'm on in my comment and both sides, in the replies, assume that I'm with them, I've never had a comment blow up like this and it's just fun to watch the notifications go kek
...Also, I don't remember what they said exactly, but I think I was kinda in the middle, don't think Derec is a delusional prick, but also, do think that he's way too extreme"
I tend to get into arguments  a lot expressing my opinions this is the best way to learn how to keep my opinions to myself.
YES
" @The_Real_Frisbee  Woman singular, Women plural."
"i wanted to talk to derrick frankly, and explain why hes wrong in allot if not all of his views and help him out of the hell hole he found himself in"
I had so many points to make
Omg same! I was literally yelling at the phone. Talking to myself out loud
Fr
i’m not just being biased but when the feminist spoke most of the time it didn’t make sense
Now y'all know how ghosts feel👌
YES!!! UUUUUUUGH😧
Not really unless ur an awful person
OMG EXACTLY
i know I'm in my room at 10 pm and I want to shout at my screen haha
 @irthatkid  I mean men are less privileged don't even get me started
 @lilyhudson6821  smh she was an actor men can easily beat up women since it's scientifically proven men are built stronger so don't even get me started I could argue for ours
"EXACTLY, feminism is the one thing that when a man has something negative to say about it I will not hold back and I will be rude."
 @rubymayx502  I mean you fight for Equal rights when it's men who should be since we're less privileged
" @bob-pl4yg  , hold up did you just say that me are UNDER PRIVILEGED?"
 @rubymayx502  no men have less privilege
" @bob-pl4yg  ,noOooOope , I agree in terms of the court and things like that aside from that no you do not."
 @rubymayx502  no we have way less privilege and I have proof to back it up
" @bob-pl4yg  go on then , give me proof that some how men have less advantages"
"mens suicide rate is 80 percent dying in combat 96 homeless around 76 custody rate 16 
Death in job around  90 something male college rate 26 women get comfort for showing emotion men don't if women are homeless it's not there fault but if men are they need to work harder feminists tell men they are demons and everything wrong with the world from a young age women can abuse rape and do more to men with no charge but if a women says a man raped her his life is ruined and many men now have no confidence in themselves because of women if we show affection that's not enough you need our money if we comfort you when you cry we want your number I can go on"
" @rubymayx502  
Read my. Message above"
Godlike TwinsYT my guy how old r u  😂

 @claudiabenedito2928  I did
Ya
I never wanted to be in such a discussion at first place!
YESS EXACTLYYYY!!!
It really is
SAME
"It’s so painful that these women actually believe feminist organizations do anything for family or criminal court biases along with society telling women they can shake they’re ass all over Instagram but take down shirtless pics of men, the bias is insane personally experience doesn’t compare to mass sexism towards men directed by the media"
RIGHT I WAS LIKE GETTING MAD AT MYSELF LMAOOO
@pawtatuh e3e Nah bro I wanted to do that and more if u know u know

 @claudiabenedito2928  I did shout at my screen so many times.
" @DominicOrnelas  Yep, a lot of people should practice their listening skills!"
Literally kept pausing to interject in my head
I was screaming at my phone haha.
"IKR! There were so many points I wanted to make to them but I couldn't, smh."

IKKK
RIGHT?? I'M SO PISSED I WANTED TO SCREAM AT MY SCREEN
for real

YESSSSS I WANTED MY FEMINISM TO JUMP TF OUT
Facts
Oh my god there is so much I wanted to say...
Can I be one to say that sometimes comments with replies are the best way to find out the actual mentality of people because there is no filter.. and sometimes when u land upon good debates going on in the comment section is like just more entertaining than Actually watching one....
" @jesusdelgado9155  first of all love ur opinions 💜...
Secondly I don't think girls said but I think they meant that there are toxic jokes which have wrong meanings and it leads normalisation which makes men feel more entitled than men...
I think that's what she meant... I think if they discussed longer like u said I think it would be more clear what they meant...
I also would want to know has the men's right activist who is also feminist Vice Versa...
Cause I think there are specific things where men's right activist especially against pseudo feminists...
But I also feel there are like real feminists who not trying to degrade men and rob them of their rights but are trying to fight for an equal ground..
Because as much as I hate to say it male dominant society.... The ratio at which a women suffers even in her daily life is nothing compared to what a man would suffer in his daily life....
I would really want a male feminist to speak up and say his views and how he would like to protects his rights as well as women's rights.."
" @rynleigh1842   Hi !!! With all respect,  think if ur a feminist u should be confident enough to say it not be ashamed of other feminists with wrong ideologies or pseudo feminists...
Otherwise it just feels like u don't want to call yourself a feminist because u urself are stereotyping feminism. ...

Its thought and question I have ..."
" @caelan8061  I could be totally wrong , just a perception but I feel Derrick said that line with no actual acknowledgement ... What I mean is I am pretty he has been rejected a job because he is incompetent  but took it to hid ego and blamed that it was because of his gender ....
I don't that line really pinched my ear is that because maybe there are cases like that but like u said the ratio is no comparable......."
" @caelan8061  I agree because I think Derrick has a one sided view to things...
I don't think he actually understands or is educated about women in this society and feminists...
Almost all the things he said happens to women but in larger ratio but he seemed ignorant to acknowledge it.."
literally agh
" @GatorBaby06  I agree but if u see the same things happens with women...men or boys get away with alot of things that women won't and women have way more restrictions than a man does.... And if u think about third world countries where it's much worse for women...

And the fact where u said men get teased for crying is toxic masculinity .... Abd then same things happen with women... It is scientifically proven that women are more emotional and then they also have period mood swings and hormones and ofcourse pregnancy hormones that last even after birth...

But still men always tease women for crying instead of understanding and not just that they stereotype that every women is like the one they see in tv who cries about little things which is so wrong .... For the longest time especially in third world countries women feared to shed a tear infront of a man or their family because physically abused...

There is so much depth to what happens in being a man or women ....
Thry both deserve equality but at the moment women are always suffering more then men....
I have not met a single women gropped or molested by a man once in their life.....these are things that happen in trains and buses ans women keep Shut because they are afraid of the male superiority because it is a male dominated society...

And that is not equal or right in anyway....."
 @tylanmdotcom  with respect could u please maybe specify what ur exact view is ??
 @inframatic  which one there were two?
" @garretsmith2578 I think alot of men stereotype feminism to be toxic feminity.....which is wrong... Not all feminists have the same views.... 
Toxic masculinity is real and both educated men and women are against it... But the thing is whenever a man doesn't like what a women does it's usually blamed at feminism...


People don't understand feminism is way different to people's perspectives of it..."
" @matthewmahese6022  100% agree w you. I'm all about supporting mens rights activism but not when its used to bring down feminism. But yeah I really do think we need mens rights activism because this patriarchal society is also destroying men w their ridiculous standards and viewpoints e.g: men dont cry, talking about your emotions is not 'manly', men cant be raped etc. There's a reason why men's suicide rate is higher than women."
this the comment because i paused the video multiple times to say my pov and im like they can't even hear me
 @claudiabenedito2928  samee omg
"I be out here shouting at my screen, mostly at Derrick, with my mom and sister like, ""Girl, what's wrong with you?"" but mannn!"
"yess ong, im screaming at the screen"
@Pawtatuh nah the black girl
Dude yes omg lmao
Facts
LITERALLY!!!!
SERIOUSLY exactly what i was thinking
LOL ikr I just shout at my screen
If Feminism wants an equality. Then why when men raped a women the man has to die by Death Penalty. But when women raped men. The woman didn't get to the jail. Because no one will believe you. If you want equality then the woman should die on death penalty too. Salary?? No. When women gets more money than man. Most woman (not all) will leave that man. I remember when someone I know that his wife is a secretary of a company and my friends job is he sells bed. Walking while carrying that bed to the houses. he do that because of his children. But in the end his wife leaves him saying I make more money than you. And she cheated on his husband for a richer guy. Richer than his salary as a secretary. That's hurts so bad. If women wants an equality. Then they should carry heavy items like us. If women wants an equality then they should go to military just like us and etc. When it comes to Women Rights. They have more rights than men. Here in my country. If the man cheated on his wife. The husband will go to jail but the Mistress won't go to jail. If the law are Equal. Then the Mistress should go to jail too. Women don't need equality. Women need Protection and Special Treatment. Geez.
Facts💀💀
I just wanna scream at Derrick 🤣
i paused it multiple times to respond
SUSSY impostor from among us

" @irthatkid  let me just quickly correct you, she’s not saying she wants it free. She’s saying that a medical necessity like utilities for your period shouldn’t have an extra tax because it’s for women. Nor should any other female hygiene product cost any different than what a man’s hygiene product should be."
RIGHHHHHTTT OMFGGGG

You can't even spell women without men
 @pinkpowercoin3341  lol would that be considered toxic feminicity [im joking]
 @pinkpowercoin3341  it wasnt condescending she was just offended to be compared to a child his analogy was spot on and it wasnt an actual comparison of women and children but the rights one would have
That’s why you have the comments section
​ @claudiabenedito2928 make a sandwich
 @eagle3676  She better be packing some kind of weapon otherwise its just not true
exactly i wish i could talk in this circle.

"Honestly, there were so many times I wanted to add stuff, Kinda dsisapointing .  . ."
"Damn, I’m sorry you could not go there to join due to your leg issue :("
Facts I mean ofc we aren't equal in every way. I do think that we are equal in most things
"Including yours, ironically enough."
I have
But was hard to find
 @angelwashere4259  hi chrollo want to have dinner and discuss Hisoka?
Check my comment. Derrick does suck but videos like this beed to have comment sections about the bigger picture
 @parkerasel8129  sorry me and kurapika have date night today ❤
Dude is hard to ignore. Likely feminism created him.
well that just sounds like hate with extra steps
I like your profilepicture
Too bad the women dislike him back XD XD
What even Are women?
" @greatfood4327  humans, I guess?"
 @kosalraman2381  the Meninists not gonna like that one 😭👑
says every incel ever
"Its sad cause with feminist if you say you are not sexist they say you are in deny but if you say toxic masculinity exists, they say your toxic too"
"11:38 she is linking us to video game, soooo sexist"
The only people who don't understand it are the ones causing the chaos
"Hate is a subset of things disliked. When I think of dislike I think of not wanting a thing or aspect of some thing. So I could see expressing a dislike of women as not wanting some aspect thats perceived as being near universally applicable to women. Which to Derek would be their rejection of him XD. He dislikes his experiences with women.

To up that to legitimate hate he would have to be angry and feel an urge for violence or wish for their non-existence. 

Dislike = Derek
Hate + mental disorders + unlikely circumstances = Elliot Roger

The distinction may seem trivial, but its the difference between seeing something undesirable to be avoided or corrected vs wanting to actively destroy something. 

Also to avoid misinterpretation I want to clarify that I don't think its healthy to dislike women in general, but it's a far cry from hatred. That would be jumping to conclusions based on oversimplifying the above distinction."
 @lukyluk_py  more like it would take extra steps to get to hate.
 jay c. smith  my wife is my best friend
LMAOOOOO GOOD EYE😂
Like
Plague
Communism
Public executions
War
Just to name a few
 @nevanleong5954  communism still exists............
" @nevanleong5954  Corona virus ain't to far from the ""plague"" bud"
That’s not what he meant though.
I just read this comment while that happened 😅
 @esl1402  the Corona virus just started. Don't stop counting yet 👌
why does he say he is an incel like its a flex
i would just love to have a conversation with Derrick
as a part of the mens community i want to apologies for Derrick
"Everyone:
Derrick: I’m whats called an incel"
"Comments: Aren’t disabled
Me: Now this is where the fun begins"
"“Is toxic masculinity real?” 
shows 24:02 minutes of toxic masculinity
😂😂😂😂"
Derricks laugh is a menace
Derrick talking about how he can’t find a girlfriend. Now we all know why
"I saw everyone talking bout how they hate Derrick and I was like who's Derrick, then I saw the men walk in and it was all clear."
"Derrick is actually making me mad, everyone was having a productive discussion and he was just taking things too far."
Derrick makes me so mad it’s unexplainable
"“The feminists are taking over!”
 “I’m an adult virgin.”"
Better title: men's rights vs feminism vs Derrick
I like how as soon as yellow jacket spoke everyone immediately knew what type of person he was and his vibe
5:13 I LOVE HOW SHE PUT DERRICK IN HIS PLACE OML
"Derrick is that type of guy that say: ""All girls are the same"" when a girl reject him"
"there was really a three-way conversation:
feminists
mens rights activists
derrick"
I feel the strong need to cry after this
"The other men were respectful and understanding, then there’s Derrick…."
Derrick is just a random dude they found on his way to McDonald’s
Because among his group it is
"he just didn't use the right word. Since he said it's his choice, he should have just said he's a virgin, which is nothing wrong with that."
What is an incel?
ifkrrr
"i knowwwww, he's like proud of it too"
"On the other side if you watch the other jublees with women, women partake in intimacy like its a flex so ....kinda got to hit that on the head"
IKR.
that’s literally what he is
 @hejjodude  regardless of what you think of him and what he is... takes alot of balls to go on camera infront of a large audience and admit to that
 @harrypottersucks12  it takes no brain cells to do that. No one in the right mind would admit to that
 @morgyhns9235  well considering the whole world hates him I’d say it took a bit of courage to do that. People like derrick lost at birth and were most likely bullied from kindergarten up to high school.
Go back to 2019
when he realize Incel is a term first used by a woman to describe herself
 @christopher4443  wait really? how would she use it?
" @harrypottersucks12  why would someone be proud of being an incel, things like that should be kept to yourself"
"Why are you defending him, he is obviously not a smart person, it is pretty obvious that he has done no research on the subject, o don’t think most men know there’s a difference between a feminist and a karen"
 @garfystan2259  I’m not defending him I just found it funny cus most people don’t openly describe themselves as an incel
" @Lukeschartau  lol i meant another guy who responded too your comment, your comment is fine, sorry for the mix up lmao"
But like there was literally no reason for him to say that. He just made people hate him and make his arguments not taken seriously anymore.
1000th like 😁
the way the lady gave him the side eye lmaooaoao she looked so disgusted by him
Probably on purpose as a social experiment

 @ramonabdiel10  it's good to see your comment gaining the high ground.
It isn't real.
agreed
​ @regisglass5464  toxic masculinity doesn't exist.
​ @regisglass5464  why do vvomen make up the vast majority of care jobs?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  do you (like the MRA's) believe men are biologically lesser parents?
"​ @regisglass5464 , they never said that. If they did, then kindly provide a timestamp.

Why do you hate masculinity?"
"​ @regisglass5464 they didn't say that. They said that vvomen generally are better at being caregivers. They also said that men are stronger. They talked about the strengths of both sexes. 

If you don't believe that vvomen are better caregivers on average, then show evidence."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""They said that vvomen generally are better at being caregivers.""
as the MRA's state this is due to biology and you try to deny them saying as such, is this because it shows toxic masculinity? Do you believe men are lesser parents?"
" @regisglass5464  but toxic masculinity doesn't exist. You can't even give any examples.

What is toxic masculinity then if you believe it exists?

I believe that men and vvomen are different."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""I believe that men and vvomen are different"" do you, like the MRA's, believe men are inherently lesser parents as one of the differences?"
" @regisglass5464  vvomen are more nurturing on average. If you disagree, please provide evidence to the contrary."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""vvomen are more nurturing on average"" and is that why the MRA's say men are biologically lesser parents? Seems odd to then say toxic masculinity does not exist if you defend men being seen as lesser parents"
" @regisglass5464  they said that vvomen are more nurturing on average. That doesn't mean that they're worse parents, just have different strengths.

If you disagree with this notion, please provide evidence to the contrary."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""they said that vvomen are more nurturing on average.""
and thus my question. Again, is that why the MRA's then say men are biologically lesser parents? Or why not quote them?"
"​ @regisglass5464  they didn't. 

Why do you believe that vvomen aren't more nurturing on average?"
 @DavidW-ng5zv   then why not quote them? But thank you for noting it is toxic masculinity for them to say men are lesser parents
"​​ @regisglass5464  they said that vvomen are more nurturing on average. 

If you disagree with this, at least explain why.

Toxic masculinity doesn't exist. How can I think that this is an example of it if it isn't real?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""they said that vvomen are more nurturing on average.""
and thus my question. Again, is that why the MRA's then say men are biologically lesser parents? Do you avoid this query because it shows toxic masculinity?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , why do you hate masculinity? You keep calling masculinity toxic.

Also, why aren't vvomen more nurturing on average? What data supports your argument?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""they said that vvomen are more nurturing on average.""
and thus the question you avoid. Again, is that why the MRA's say men are biologically lesser parents? Is this toxic masculinity?
Either way, thank you for showing only feminism helps people"
"​ @regisglass5464 toxic masculinity doesn't exist, so no, it's not ""toxic masculinity.""

Feminism teaches vvomen to hate men. How is this helpful?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and why isn't it toxic masculinity for MRA's to say men are lesser parents due to their biology? 
Why wouldn't opposing this view help in custody cases?"
"​ @regisglass5464 it is because ""toxic masculinity"" doesn't exist.

Do you believe that all masculinity is toxic?

Feminism pushes the notion that m en are evil and that masculinity is toxic and is bad for custody battles"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for agreeing that the MRA's state men are biologically lesser parents. thus, why isn't that MRA's pushing ""the notion that m en are evil and that masculinity is toxic""? Or is normal to see men as biologically lesser parents?"
Toxic feminity is real
"​ @regisglass5464 , you haven't explained why you believe that vvomen aren't more nurturing on average. 

The feminists were arguing that masculinity is toxic and that men oppress vvomen. That is pushing hatred of men."
"​ @regisglass5464 , but the feminists were the ones arguing that masculinity is toxic. The feminists also argued that vvomen are oppressed. 

Why can't you answer my question as to why vvomen make up the vast majority of care jobs?"
"​ @regisglass5464  because the feminists agreed with the prompt that masculinity is toxic.

Also, feminism is the belief that vvomen are oppressed by men. So this then teaches vvomen to hate men."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for agreeing that the MRA's state men are biologically lesser parents and noticing this is toxic masculinity by now trying to blame the feminists for it. So why is it helpful for men to be seen as biologically lesser parents?
" @regisglass5464  but the feminists did say that masculinity is toxic (just as you are doing now as you keep talking about ""toxic masculinity"").

Why do you believe that vvomen are not more nurturing on average? The evidence says that they are, so you need to show evidence to prove otherwise."

Greasel Snatches GOOD
"@Greasel Snatches They're actually not. Radical feminism is a particular branch of feminism, and it's the one that most people think of when they think of feminists (i.e., man haters)--but it actually makes up a smaller portion of overall feminism and is usually disliked even by other feminist groups."

YES.
Ikr!!!
Everyones rights vs Derrick
"Derrick didn't know how to express what he was thinking. I do understand where he's coming from because I wouldnt necessarily say I'm opposed to what he's saying. I do believe he's beliefs are men were built to protect the young and protect the mother. Thats just how our brains are wired. And it is because of other men who harm women that we do that. I think he's trying to say is he's in favor of that perfect family from an 80s or 90s sitcom but with the ground that women have gained through voting rights and equal pay and all of that stuff. He said he was an Incell, in other words he doesn't talk much so he doesn't exactly know how to talk. When he told the other guy to talk before him at the end it wasn't because he was frustrated or anything like that or spite women, he just didn't know how to convey his thoughts into words so that he doesn't immediately hang himself. The tension was very high so I do feel some sympathy for him. Also kinda same about girls can really just find a guy with the snap of a finger. Every girl I've met is talking to at least 3 different guys. Not all are romantic interests but there are definitely more single men than there are women. In my community at least."
"Check his channel, he might actually have killed himself"
" @jaydenbutwhy4778  I can't find his channel, do you have a link?"
Yeah derrick is contradicting his own sides points
 @jaydenbutwhy4778  what’s the channel name?
" @jerodwolford2743  i agreed with almost most of the stuff he said. BUT if u wanna prove ur point and prove that YOU are right then u have to say it in a way to get ppl to believe you and respect u. If u dont its rly hard, because the person on the opposite site gets annoyed by the way ur saying it and already disagrees. If there is a person who takes a look in both sides and yk, considers stuff well, then he will have to understand on his own by looking deep into what ur saying to try and understand on his own. Cause when u already are pissed off by someone u refuse to get to understand his point. Thats what i did and i actually agree with him as i said"
This is so funny 😂😭😹
😂😂😂
Omg fr
Derrick do be pulling that 1v5 what a chad.
Lmao

 @jaydenbutwhy4778  I wanna see
Yes
Why derrick
wtf yes
Better title=humans vs derrick
I'm so ashamed
LMFAO
 @sc6rlets  whats the name
The way I saw this comment before I watch the video and recognize who Derrick was before his name was brought up—
" @saharaofthedeep  He said patriarchy, not, “Hey let’s go back in time and experience and this criminality against women once more!” If he did they, they would’ve walked out of the room on the spot. 

Patriarchy is just a system/society of gov where father is head of household. It’s nothing uncommon to this day, it’s just less used. When your father called you your or calls to you depending on your age, did you or do you answer and come to him, or just ignore him or wait for him?

Society has accepted man’s power over women because biologically it makes more sense. The stronger person who is more capable to hide their emotions is the person that takes all of the heavy roles.

The only relevance patriarchy has to anything you mentioned as examples is that it was an extreme commonality at that time. Also, I can’t help but notice you said “we” in all of your examples leading me to the implication that women were no exception to the occurrences and what caused them.

Times change, they were less advanced and they gave themselves reasons to fear which they then chose to make valid. Them being less advanced led them to those choices, it had nothing to do with patriarchy. Even had there been split power between genders, it still would’ve occurred. They didn’t come to the conclusion that women could be witches for no reason, they had their fears and women sharing power as partial would’ve made no difference. If anything, they would’ve assumed the leader was a witch and killed her.

I would be shocked if he were imagining all of that along with church and the la-di-das. Him not talking much and not being able to make a full sentence led you to jump to conclusions. He may think that, but hey, I suppose we will never know."
Yes
"The fact that dude said feminist ideology is a FALLACY, says it all. Also appreciated the inclusion of the incel, for tge obvious reasons."
BAHAHAHA STOPPP IM LAUGHING SO HARD
Facts 🤣🤣
THIS!
Yeah Derrick is just a sexist kid. I see the value on both sides
Right?
Even the other two MRAs.
Yep
Agree
Men's rights activists vs. Men haters
Ikr omg!!
That's hilarious 😂
He’s just sexist honestly
"I just thought he was just unsure until he mentioned going back to the past. That was when it showed that why he wanted to go back was because he wanted even more privilege and he wanted women to be silenced. Because that is exactly what happened in those times. It wouldn't be happier for us, it would be happier for him since he can live with his mysoginy, toxic masculinity and sexism in peace."
no one there liked him💀💀
 @sc6rlets  What's his channel tho?
Society Vs Derrick
FR
AHAHAHHHHA
Derrick is just against human rights in general
Ahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahah😐
juice wrld said it dont u ever disrespect juice
 @manu-nz7vc  what? I dont understand
Or the girls who say it about guys
Derrick is just derrick
 @Emma-qi6hd  juice wrld made a song called all girls are the same
Derrick is Derrick but he’s not completely wrong there
 @Emma-qi6hd  that’s juice wrlds song
THEY ROTTIN MY BRAINS!!!
"to be fair, I'm sure all the girls he has ever met have rejected him"
😂
"Actually, he never even had the oppurtunity to meet properly a girl. They can flee him from miles away"
Ain’t y’all the same ones who be saying kam and turn lesbian after a breakup🤨
" @wazzzaapp5645  well i am a lesbian that never dated a boy plus: 
W
H
A
T
Wait u mean that some girls actually says this things??? Never know that nel thanks for telling me! Have a nice day!"
But that’s like saying “Girls are the type to say : KAM after a breakup” 😬😐
 @yokiie3544  juice world likes you
"That's what women say about men after their supposedly terrifying experiences with patriarchy led men. They generalize personal experience to every single men. Besides, any problem they face with any man is the result of some abstract being that is oppressing women but, at the same time, is biased favoring women with movements like feminism being promoted by even the United Nations. Really funny. They believe gender roles are the result of patriarchy when, in reality, gender roles come from biology and are easily observed in other animals but they need to create some social construct theory to keep fighting against the evil patriarchy that will never be defeated. That's how you create a business for eternity. Smart really."
 @requiem5151  ?
 @masterchief4421  ?
 @samuel123dahm3  Who literally says kam-
 @mintchocxlate7154  a lot of girls after they break up with you on ROBLOX.

"lol, ur comment is right under the one u copied"
Sarah Jade fr
"Bruh, copied"
There’s always a Derrick
Period
Period luv
Stolen comment. Get original
4 way Mimi is a clear misandrist
No there was a lecture from the feminists. Every time the men tried to speak it was always “but”. When the men  made a point they just completely dismissed it and said what they wanted to say instead. What a terrible approach.
Stealing comments is wrong.
Kursat getting no loveM
Copied
"Let's not degrade the fact that the other men's rights activists were terrible too... At the end of the day all of them are bad, we can't make excuses for the other men's rights activists. Your making it look like the rest of the men's rights activists were somewhat on the same side as the feminists, which they were not. Derrick is not the only bad person"
" @heyboo9943  how were they terrible? Thsnk God they weren't on the same side, else their position would be obsolete."
 @kardz1848  That's what we want
 @heyboo9943  you want to make discourse between 2 opposing sides obsolete? Would you prefer violence
 @waterantonio1038  😂😂
 @heyboo9943  How were they terrible?????!!!!!!!!!!
 @heyboo9943  Really... that's it? What's wrong with that?
 @quronmccovery881  They're mysoginistic!? wtf is wrong with u
" @heyboo9943  Nothing's wrong with me, I'm even insulted by the implication. Zach was actually pretty polite and open-minded, and Kursat was respectful, even when being as blunt as a lead pipe. Derrick was the only one with an unhealthy view of women."
" @quronmccovery881  I apologise for suggesting that something was wrong with you instead of approaching the matter appropriately. I suppose this is somewhat correct, although I disagree immensely with what they value the fact that they weren't loud and obnoxious like a lot of Men's Rights activists was fair. Derrick was horribly arrogant and disrespectful, I am glad that we can agree on that."
"Nope, it was normal women vs 3 incels"
 @udhav423  How were all three men incels? And are we gonna act like two of the women weren't being unreasonable?
" @quronmccovery881  I think people in the comments don't get what a Men's rights activist is.  Pretty much how some people think that feminism = anti-men, which it obviously isnt."
" @Fulgrim_The_Phoenician  Not only are you a WH40K fan, but you are also incredibly based."
 @quronmccovery881  excuse me? I hope you are joking. How am I 'based' and what does it have to do with W40k?
 @sinclaiir  so is the other one who isn’t bea
Well after all without men phones tv's cars planes apps u use and a lot more wouldn't exist without guys
Everybody stfu it’s a comment if this were the case multiple YouTubers would’ve cancelled for uploading videos of them Playing games other YouTubers have played
Lmao
But true
Prolly
Dammm dont be dissing McDonalds like that
YES
lol my fault mcdonald’s is dont want no dusty dude name derrick
The yellow jacket guy is just mad because he can’t get a girl...
"This was almost perfect, and then we have Derrick"
Equal rights equal fights square up
Derek definitely has his moms contact as “Spawnpoint”
"This video should be called ""Everyone vs Derrick: Should Derrick be allowed to have access to the internet?"""
"Women have locker room talk too. They just dont call it that. They talk about men in lewd ways. I didnt know that until i started dating my lady and shes talking to me about the gossip she has with her friends and im sitting there thinking ""i dont need to know this stuff about these guys"""
Holy this is intense
Derrick has nothing to add to the conversation. He is just a little kid with very minimal real life experience.
The black girl looked at Derrick in 100 different languages in the beginning😂
"I'm a rare ""gen-Z"" female that is very much for men's rights and going back to some of the ways that we followed in the past. I continue to watch women continuously fall into their own trap. Ego runs in mankind (this includes women). I do believe men and women should be equal. Women are going too far these days, treating men the way we hated to be treated. I understand however, feeling preyed upon by certain men. ""The boys"" mentality that caused women to act like this in the first place. Actual toxic men. I don't know about this ""toxic masculinity"" subject. I think it's an oversight. Instead of pinpointing those actual perpetrators. It's almost aiding them, rather than holding them accountable. A distraction. Nonetheless, the focus on those few guys that hurt them, shows how many women have black and white thinking. We need a better system that doesn't push this narrative. They often don't even try to fix their own pattern of going for the same results over and over again. Blaming all of the opposite gender for fear of hurting them again. It's easier to simply stay away altogether. Instead of try for a different outcome and keep a victim mentality. Unfortunately, this causes women to keep getting the same result over and over again. All sides should take accountability and learn to work together through open communication. Learn to accept differences of opinion. Then proceed with understanding."
The open hostility from the women says everything I need to know.
we all know derrick has never had a girlfriend and never will
i think the middle ground for feminists and mens rights activists is that we dont like derrick LMAO
derrick was the worst from the male group and mimi was the wrost from the feminist group
"Me: Comes to comments to look for insightful opinions.
Everyone: Derrick"
The way they’re looking at them says everything. They came not to listen but to talk. No middle ground was reached and that’s sad.
"“Toxic masculinity is real”
Derick: smirks while women walk up"
They should definitely redo this one
15:30 the lady gets upset and starts crying and saying the guys are dismissing her when all they did was ask for her to elaborate or share some of her own experiences like damn nice getting pissy when they care and want to understand.
When Derrick says he's studied something - it means he's been on google and youtube for a few hours.
 Reaganomics •101  women are oppressed here as well
"​ Reaganomics •101  I am a woman lives in a third world country.

It is very strange for you to say this because for us to achieve rights, equality must be achieved in developed countries. If equality had been achieved in developed countries, we would be in a better position right now. Moreover, every work done by the feminists there gives us courage and happiness. We are not enemies but partners of each other."
"tHe yeLloW JaCket GuY 
you just made my day"
" @gulkizbarut  I find flaws in that logic. You’d need to fight for your rights rather than believing that if a first world country has equity, than everything would be better. Sure it’d help as they would be inclined to help your people, but protest or do something to help yourselves as well"
" Zack Snyder  he's not a simp. A simp would treat women like a queen, when he wants traditional values and probably imagines himself as a macho man"
" @a_random_person_lol_bruh  Believe me, we too are fighting for our rights. We fight even more than you do. Even when protesting, the police interfere with us. We do our best. When women are killed by their husbands, their sentence is reduced because they don't enjoy killing. I don't expect citizens in developed countries to understand because protesting is yours. As you might think, it's not an easy thing around here, and despite that, there are a lot of protests. AND women are being taken into custody in a run-down way. We fight for our own rights. My comment was to the person above. Something the feminist movement has done in the world gives power to women in other countries as well. This is what i am trying to say"
" @a_random_person_lol_bruh  Their logic is not flawed. Third world countries typically have unstable governments, who often times attempt to control the population. In South Eastern Africa, (probably more if I’m not mistaken) the apartheid was quite literally a minority government taking control over the general population and killing or imprisoning them whenever they protested. This resulted in years and years of fights for equality with no result. Once the countries that colonized the affected region of Africa started seeing outcry in first world countries, as well as the African countries, they made changes. The same principle applies for women’s rights. It’s always most difficult to be the first to do something the people want, rather than following in someone else’s footsteps, just as third world countries do."
This is so true lol
Or that he’s in the closet.
 Reaganomics •101  are you a woman?
"If tubby over here changed up his apparel, his attitude, groomed his hair, took a shower for once, lost weight he could be reeling in women like he Pope Sweet Jesus 

But nah this “incel” mentality he’s doing this as a rebellious phase pretty much throwing a temper tantrum because he can’t get any play"
Seems like that
"HEY,don't disrespect the bee"
True

" PT  fair, but when your opinion is that one group of people is better than another group of people for something that they physically can not control, then it is no longer really an opinion, it's a lack of knowledge."
 PT  homie did you not watch the video
 PT  ain't censoring just saying that there is a difference between sharing an opinion and insulting an entire group of people
HAHAHAHHA
"Should Derrick be allowed to have internet access?

Hell no, he shouldn’t even be with society"
😂😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣 I feel like he was genuinely trying but just kept going so so wrong.
 @Maplemoon48  yep that's what happens everytime I try to talk as well
 @johngravesyt  same 😔
No he should not
" @johngravesyt  but insulting an entire group is sharing an opinion !? LOL and i donn't think they said ""do not insult an entire group"" but more ""Please share your opinion with a little bit of respect"""
"omg, best comment ever"
Absolutely not
 @shivarg120  lol thanks
 @applenuggets662  should you?
"I fully agree, right from the start I was like ""here we go"" I knew exactly what he was bringing to the table. The women definitely handled the immaturity and ignorance well."
he’s definitely a redditor or discord mod
He needs to look up to smth he doesnt has
No. No he should not.
i can't hahahahaahahah
I cackled at this 😭
LITERALLY
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Derrick is such a bad example of men right activist
 @jose91807  yeah lol
as a girl not rlly
" @ashy7230  you're saying women(in general, not just you) don't discuss men in lewd details?"
"​ @ashy7230 , nothing wrong with locker room talk."
" @ashy7230  The ""locker room"" isn't literal it's a metaphor. What women call ""girl talk"" is what people call men's ""locker room"" talk."
 @riven4121  “girl talk” is also just mostly women exclusive problems such as periods lmao
" @ashy7230  For you maybe, for a lot of women they are the exact same thing. The things I've heard women discuss under the guise of ""girl talk"" is insane."
 @riven4121  like what?
"​ @ashy7230 
Judging other women for their preferences and showing extreme interest in others superficial traits 

There's a reason why certain things are discussed in exclusive groups 
And there's nothing necessarily wrong with that."
You just dont see what hes saying
"LeCeaseDaProducer, what is he saying?? He said he wishes to go back to the 50s because him and his greasy hair can’t get a girlfriend so he wants to force a girl into a relationship."
 @Scheemar  he Is just old fashioned and traditional. He wants to go back to a time when god came first in our lives. Where men loved and respected ONE woman. And woman allowed their men to feel like men. Not today's day where the girl you texting got 5 side guys.
But to be fair younger people are able to give a more creative and insightful opinion which in general would make a conversation better but that just doesn't happen here which might be so just because no one understands him his opinion are different from the others who are trying to avoid offending the other side but he had to get his point through which make him seem like an asshole and that is why the comment section dislikes him
 @Cassiuss  damn Right
 @LeseAlafaio92  does he see?
I would say he said everything a generic Feminist is but they definitely aren't as bad as other Feminist otherwise it's a 💯 tho saying that face to face is 😳🤪🤯
Finally an intellectual
Facts omg he talked so much but said nothing 😭
I think it's important to include a younger guy with an immature opinion to make this group work. Gotta see the things you haven't yet. He may be the one who benefits most from these conversations. He clearly needs it
 @mountainsteward7776  Damn thats amazing so true and so terrible
 @kaledoublescope   The others seemed a lot more well researched and used studies to back up but he hardly seemed to perepare riding on barebones that won't last him long
Queen A there are 2 black girls...can’t you describe her with a different adjective? Why does it always have to be about race?
@Andrew But they still didn't specify... d r e a m s points this out. It's not like they provided height or whatever so this is a valid argument.
"I mean, I cant tell who Queen A is talking about."
d r e a m s uh oh person who thinks describing someone’s race is racist
@Andrew this isn't a police questioning andrew. And see where youd escribe what they were wearing? Exactly. That's the point
And the white girl was just like eww get away from me the whole time.
" @kuralanna  why does it matter? I'm an African american and I am used to being called black, and I'm proud about my race.

Question is why are you being offended"
"d r e a m s yeah, they weren’t meaning it as racism, and race isn’t always associated with identifying it’s just easier I guess. If someone said that white girl was looking at him with 100 different languages, would it have the same effect? Yes."
"Andrew exactly my mom is in the police world and she asks for race as well. They can’t tell u what they are wearing but not their race because say they are white, and a Mexican is wearing something very similar, who’s who?"
 @kuralanna  bruh she was the only one looking at him like that. Dont act
 @kuralanna  so your telling me if 10 with brown eyes and black hair stems standing with all the same cloths and theres one black one you dont say your describing the black one?
18:59 dang dat death stare😦💀
d r e a m s you sound like a person who says saying Your black is racist
 @kuralanna  well because it is a big factor for identifying people
 @kuralanna  why do i think you were offended by his comment ?
"""I do believe men and women should be equal."" 
ironically, the MRA's disagree with you. you should probably interact with more feminists since you are already partial to their views."
​ @regisglass5464  then why does feminism teach vvomen to hate men?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus my question. if the MRA's don't hate men, why do they state men are lesser parents?"
" @regisglass5464  they don't state that.

Why does feminism teach vvomen to hate men?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  thank you for noting it is misandry for the MRA's to state men are lesser parents. Thus, isn't that us agreeing only feminists help people per stating men and women are equals?"
" @regisglass5464  they said that vvomen are better caregivers.

Is it misogyny to say that men are physically stronger than vvomen?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  thank you for accepting the MRA's stated women are biologically better parents, ie, you agree the MRA's are misandrists. Or would you like to quote them if not? 
Does having muscles make men worse parents or are the feminists correct that the sexes are equal?"
" @regisglass5464  why do vvomen make up the vast majority of care role jobs?

Why are biological realities sexist?"
​ @DavidW-ux2gc it is not okay to be a misandrist and misogynistic
"​ @regisglass5464 I was using biological realities. M en can't menstuate or give birth, but they are physically stronger. 

Why do vvomen make up the vast majority of those in care positions? Kindly answer the question."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's odd, you believe that menstruating and giving birth makes an inherently better parent? 
Thank you for showing why only feminists help people"
"​ @regisglass5464 , if feminism helps men, why are more and more men (particularly young men) becoming anti-feminist?

You never answered my question as as to why vvomen make up the vast majority of those in care jobs."
" @regisglass5464  if you believe that it's not okay to be misandrist, why do you hate men?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, as you believe menstruating and giving birth makes an inherently better parent, thank you for showing why only feminists help people."
 @DavidW-ux2gc  thank you for agreeing it is not okay to be an MRA as per their misandry and misogyny
​ @regisglass5464  MRAs are better than feminists.
"​ @regisglass5464 , but feminism doesn't help men.

Why do vvomen make up the vast majority of care jobs? It's odd that you avoid this query."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  as stated, as you believe menstruating and giving birth makes an inherently better parent, thank you for showing why only feminists help people by fighting for equality."
"​​ @regisglass5464 , why are most people in care jobs vvomen?

VVomen are more people-oriented."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, as you believe menstruating and giving birth makes an inherently better parent or, apparently, gives you better people skills, thank you for showing why only feminists fight for equality."
"​ @regisglass5464 vvomen are more interested in people, and men are more interested in things. 

Why can't you explain why vvomen make up the vast majority of those in care jobs?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  as stated, since you demonstrate MRAs believe menstruating and giving birth makes a biologically better parent and, apparently, have better people skills, thank you for showing why only feminists fight for equality."
"​ @regisglass5464  so you have no argument. All you can do is scream ""sexism.""

Feminism is a joke.

As you can't answer my question, you have lost the argument."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  you are welcome to believe so, but since you demonstrate MRAs believe menstruating and giving birth makes a biologically better parent and, apparently, grants better people skills, thank you for showing why only feminists fight for equality."
 @DavidW-ux2gc  but thank you for showing it is not okay to be an MRA as per their misandry and misogyny (which you defend)
"​ @regisglass5464 , so why do vvomen make up the vast majority of those in care jobs? Please answer the question. 

It's telling that you have no real argument."
 @regisglass5464  what have you done for men?
" @DavidW-ux2gc  not be an MRA, and therefore not be a misandrist and misogynist."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus my statement. Since you demonstrate MRAs believe menstruating and giving birth makes a biologically better parent and, apparently, gives better people skills, thank you for showing why only feminists fight for equality. Or does the MRA position help men in custody cases?"
​ @regisglass5464  what have you ever done for men? You've never done anything.
"​ @regisglass5464 , so how is feminism going to fight biology? What has feminism done for men?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  as stated, per believing that menstruating and giving birth makes a biologically better parent and, apparently, gives better people skills, thank you for showing why only feminists fight for equality. 
Or does said MRA position help men in custody cases? seems odd you avoid this query."
"​ @regisglass5464  vvomen are better suited at caregiving roles. Why are the vast majority of care roles undertaken by vvomen? Answer the question. 

The MRA position does help men in custody cases."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  as you now state that MRA's saying men are biologically worse parents helps men, thank you for showing exactly why only feminists help people"
"​ @regisglass5464 , and what have feminists done to help men?

You haven't shown why what was said was wrong. All you've done is claim sexism."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, as you state it is helpful for MRA to say men are biologically worse parents per not menstruating, thank you for showing exactly why only feminists help people by opposing these views"
"​ @regisglass5464 , so again, explain why the belief that vvomen are more nurturing on average is wrong?"
We need more smart women like you.
 @rjmunster9600  that's what a loser would say.
VVomen are going too far these days? I didn't know we are at point where women have made majority of today's crime. Can you list a study of such cases?
" @nasrinnski  check you privileges, you don't need to make illegal acts to be immoral."
what open hostility what are you talking about💀
 @squid4484  the women except for the one in the middle weren't understanding on mens issues AT ALL. They projected their own personal feelings and let them take over rather than talking in a civil manner.
What hospitality this is exactly why Derrick is gonna father your children
Derrick knocks you out cold
Derrick will be knock your shoes off
"​ @squid4484 hypocracy coming from the woman's side, constant interruption,and let's not forget they didn't want to view the men's perspective but wanted the men to view theirs 😂"
"I mean he did claim at the start of the vid that he was an ""Incel""😅😅"
Ez G just come out already
"Ez G 
Seems like someone’s salty"
Oh hahahah😂😂👏
"YES 
WE CAN AGREE ON THIS"
"I didn't really like Derrick, there was just something about him that pissed me off."
 @starstruck6162  yea he made no sense
 @starstruck6162  actually nvm he would probably turn the whole therapy center insane
I was your 1000th like CONGRATS EYY
@Mati _Mistrz and toxic masculanity too. Don't forget that :)
Yea he went way to far here 3:56  I mean we can all agree that everyone should have equal rights
And now we know why he is an incel 🤣
 @connormielewski everyone does have equal rights😂
 @rockyoulikeahurricane3707  I know
"I was laughing so hard when Mimi said “I don’t need you to protect me, but I need you to not harm me” is she also gonna say that to any aggressors in her life? If she can protect herself she didn’t need to add that last part in"
when he said he feels empathy with girls who were “lost”… bro didnt think this one through 😂😂
I think Mimi was the worst of all
Same😤
DR.LILJAY It’s because he shouldn’t of been there
" @erickamunoz9497  I think he should, Ericka, he's an archetype, a representation of the mentality of a lot of people out there. I do think it's inherently problematic to give more volume to people with those opinions, but in this specific contest with the potential of counterpoints, it might have been constructive. Would not give him a YouTube channel, though, intolerance towards intolerance isn't hypocritical."
" @leonvwerneck1  ""intolerance towards intolerance isn't hypocritical.""
It can be. What counts as intolerance and who gets to make that call?
If your ""intolerance towards intolerance"" is greatly disproportionate to the intolerance itself, then that is hypocritical. Likewise if one is authorized to decide what counts as intolerance and another is not, then you can have a situation where: A(authorized party) does something mildly intolerant to B(non-authorized party) deeming it acceptable and not intolerant, B responds exactly in kind, A deems that intolerant and therefore worthy of escalation.
Otherwise I think I agree."
Sarcastic Aquarius right??? I was like dude come on
"he was illustrating the concept very well indeed (well done, Derrick !)"
Pichon Salomé how does that display toxic masculinity💀
"The whole time I was like ""Derick you're literally a great example of toxic masculinity"""
" @Top_Cheeze  1) I'm not a bully
2) thank you for proving that I am wrong. I am now fully aware on other sides of Toxic Masculinity. I don't know if that makes sense to what I just said. But genuinely, thank you."
U call that toxic masculinity? 😂😂😂😂
Then let’s talk about the belittlement of the guy at 16:35
"I think she was stressed being taken back to those moments and experiences when he asked that I feel bad for both of them. As a woman, I have been placed in situations like hers and everytime I look back on what happened it make me uncomfy and emotional because it hurts to know that not all men can value boundaries and straight up “no.” But I don’t think that I guy meant any harm😭"
Gives me blm activist vibes😬
 @camilol518  It's a debathe though she shouldn't have started sharing if she didn't want to contimnue of course people will want to follow up thats the entire point
 @Heejinbunny  I totally agree with you I’m just saying as I woman I can understand why she got stressed but she shouldn’t have brought it up if she knew that those memories are sensitive to bring up during things like this.
you mean on r/incel
this is a horrible joke i almost killed my self
 @DiscAgent  Derrick is that you?
 Reaganomics •101  damn I played myself by replying to a troller bot.
"Hey you guys, it’s real. There really is a sisterhood of women who are against men. Feminism is their disguise, look into “Lady Ishtar”- The goddess of war and love. The love she gives is used against you."
 @victoralejandrotrimmerestr3672  BHAHAHA
"You forgot reddit, infowars, Paul Joseph Watson, and Ben Shapiro."
" Reaganomics •101  I agree western women are more privileged than women from other places but women have not gotten all rights they deserve, there’s still a long way to go for us. But women and men are equal and we should work together and reach a common ground. Just because western women don’t suffer the same things as other women doesn’t mean that their troubles should be discarded."
Google CAN be a scientific source though.  You can find sources of universities etc.
 @cybercipher5770  google is a search engine… you can use it to find studies but you can also use it to find completely false sources framed as being true. Anti vax studies for example lol.
1 minute*
Google and YouTube for a few hours is valid research though. I've been producing music for a year now and I learned all my skills from youtube and google.
He is reddit in its human form
They should have gotten a man feminist and a woman men’s rights person... or just replaced Derrick.
"Somebody needs to tell Derrick that ""Heath Ledger's Joker"" is not a valid personality."
"As a girl myself I would say that both genders have different privileges and face different problems, financially speaking it’s easier for men but when it comes to dating it’s easier for women. Also sometimes I envy men because they can go out alone at any time they want with a smaller chance of getting attacked on the street.."
"It's moments like this where Jubilee expose their clear biases. They used an incel to represent a mens rights movement, yet he didn't advocate for men once, or speak against feminism once. All he did was give his take on where women belong in society.
In addition to that, they only bring up stats whenever the men are talking."
Derrick digs himself into a deeper hole with everything he says
sorry but derrick was just disrespectful and rude laughing at what the women say
"Derrick: “I’m also known as an incel”
Me: “Aight i’m boutta head out”"
"jesus, derrick wasn’t lying when he said he was an incel."
"You can see the frust on everyone's face when derrick speaks , like not only from the feminist side but from the MA side too , they are like ""why gotta open you mouth"""
She complained about the anger men are giving out .. and she got angry about something that angered her too.
Biggest mistake was bringing an incel to the conversation.
"Woman here. I will give credit where credit is due, no matter HOW rude Alyesha or Mimi were to them, Zach and Kursat weren't rude back; they didn't interrupt and berate back. When they acted crappy and were extremely rude, they didn't act that way back. They listened and they were polite and empathetic, and they didn't say anything unkind. They were very polite and respectful, and you don't see that anymore. Props to them."
"Derrick opens mouth

Feminist: ""stares motherfuckerly"""
bro introduced himself as an incel☠️☠️
"Zach such a chill dude, we should all try to be like Zach. Zach is the pinnacle of assertive, understanding, and being in control of yourself."
Derrick was... well he definitely Fite his character and personality💀
Did anyone else read the comments about Derrick and immediately know who he was before he introduced himself just by looking at him
My boy asked a question and she just flew off the handle at him…
"Derrick is a psychopath, that’s all that needs to be said on this video."
"""Toxic masculinity"" tends to boil down to (at least) 2 things: 1) Describing what can be toxic behavior among humans overall (not men specifically) and also not as systematic as feminists tend to claim. 2) When the contrast i brought up, what would define ""healthy masculinity"" its essentially means men has to be more like women, for instance show/deal with emotions the exact same way or its just ""toxic""."
tbh replacing derrick would make them agree on everything
yesss
 Quantum x Relativity  You get two seats and double money!!!
yes
" Quantum x Relativity  same here, sexism affects both men and women and thus, equality should be achieved for both."
 doomzone megabomb  lmao fr
FEMINISM IS THE BELIEF ALL MEN N WOMAN ARE EQUAL ... here men are again coming up w something to make them superior ? exactly what Bea said why do they feel the need ???
" @alyssalong1794  I would disagree.  I know some feminists that believe in equality, but also have seen some that want superiority"
 @swordchicken1671  um have you looked up the definition?? by definition it is the equality of men and women just how ppl act who label themselves this does not change the definition and the original movement
however i do believe the whole reason for this “men rights” ?? ( which they already have ?) is to cancel any headway the feminist movement is making ... there was no men’s rights throughout all these years .. with the media feminism is really growing.. toxic men can’t handle it
" @alyssalong1794  It doesn't matter what the definition or original intent was, I can judge a political movement by its actions.  I would've supported the feminist movement 40-120 years ago, fighting for equality is important.  But now, the feminist movement is mostly pushing for superiority.  I know plenty of people that say they're feminists and stand for equality, but the movement itself and most people in it have switched to superiority"
" @alyssalong1794  Now let me ask you something, did you watch the video?  The men's rights activists made several arguments showing that men are obviously discriminated against in certain areas.  They don't ""already have"" equal rights in these areas.  And the men's rights activists were not trying to silence or belittle feminists (with the glaring exception of Derrick, and if you look at any comment on the list, you'll see that nobody likes him, even the men)"
" @swordchicken1671  I will certainly admit men are less likely than the woman to receive justice in family court and i do think it needs to change. However instead of making ur own movement.. pitch in and try to bring the feminist movement back to the definition, the real reason why there is a feminist movement. Equality of men and women. I am interested in ur opinion on that situation."
i’m sorry to only mention the family court i know men experience more disadvantages but less on a day to day level as women per say.
" @alyssalong1794  I think the reason they didn't just join the feminist movement is because the feminist movement has gone so radically towards a ""superiority of women"" stance (I'd like to reiterate that not all feminists are like this, but the movement itself and many vocal members are).  The men's rights activists, (at least some of them.  There are definitely also some misogynists) stand for equality, which is what the feminist movement started off as.  So, in a way, the men's rights activists have gone back to the definition of the feminist movement, but the feminist movement itself has moved away from that."
"I don't think the majority of the feminist movement would welcome the men's rights activists into the fold, so that's why they didn't try to join and bring it back to the definition"
" @swordchicken1671  I feel they would tho ? If of course that man believe and also feels strongly about a women’s rights. Which forgive me i’m not that educated in the MRA because i think it’s blasphemy ( but still open to conversation of course) But what the MRA represented in this video is far from the equality of both men and women, which you suggested the men’s movement was veering more towards than the feminism movement. I also feel like men may be thinking that women are making feminism about women because of the name ?? ofc cuz it’s feminism and female and all that it could be intimidating"
" @alyssalong1794  Feminism being called feminism because of females is obviously a factor.  Men's rights activists want to focus on the rights of men, and while the goal is still equality, the name feminism would kind of be a detractor from the focus on men's rights"
" @alyssalong1794  Honestly we need a new movement.  Not sure what it should be named.  Equalism sounds vague and could be applied to other things.  But in any case there should be a movement strictly focused on overall gender equality, where the men and women's rights movements can find middle ground and not have to deal with radicals on either side"
Yes! Please replace Derrick he's the worst. Everything he says makes me cringe so hard.
 Quantum x Relativity  me too
 @alyssalong1794  Feminism isn't what it was when this movement started.
 Quantum x Relativity  so you support equality. High five!
Quantum x Relativity that makes you support true equality
 doomzone megabomb  Derrick is a different species
"Go watch Roma Army, its all bout mens righs and such"
That would be so interesting!
Please replace Derrick
frrrrrr
YES
 Quantum x Relativity  you’re an egalitarian
"Could've just stopped at ""just [replace] Derrick"""
Please get rid of Derrick
"i actually didnt mind seeing all three extreams of mra

i actually wish they did that with the feminists"
" @alyssalong1794  sorry superior how exactly?

it would provide a different perspective that nether the female feminists and the mras would have and would further the discussion"
 @swordchicken1671   It's tally on both sides there are some feminist people who are like that n also some men's right activist also who are also like that but them(those type of people) together are considered as negative people who either doesn't want equality. But if we want equality we should see every person as a human and not as any specific gender..
" @invictuskynta1952  I agree with you for the most part.  There are sexists on both sides, and we should strive for equality."
" @swordchicken1671  so cant we just call it gender equality, because there are people in both Men's Rights and Feminism who believe in superiority, (though with feminists, it really is not a lot of them)."
 @swordchicken1671  yeah it's called gender equality.
 @thefabulousoogabooga6410  Atm men are at risk because woman can abuse a man and get away with it. Man cant fight back because of education. The justice system is corrupt and doesnt take men abused by woman cases seriously.
" @isaacpowrie465  Yeah, that is extremely wrong and it saddens me. Men and Women are both human beings and should be treated as such.
People base important decisions on gender stereotypes which can be very harmful, such as the example you just gave me."
 @thefabulousoogabooga6410  I phrased it wrong though. Only some woman abuse men and the system most woman are wonderful but I cant tell and it puts me off ever getting married. But hopefully I find a soul mate and the justice system is reworked so it benefits both genders.
" @isaacpowrie465  Yeah, and I'm sure you will find someone who will truly love you."
"Just replacing Derrick would be enough, thank you"
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Derrick was definitely dragging down the men's points
I felt Derrick was so misogynistic
You are right with the Derrick part
yah i think they kinda biased this feminism to only women fighting for it... i wish they could have brought a mans point of view for a support
Yo lowkey that would of been a great yet civil debate
Replace Derrick
women that are a part of men's rights are pick me girls😐
Can you please name a female mens' rights activist?
All 3 actually.
Yeah pretty much
" @swordchicken1671  the people who want superiority I like to call them “modern feminist” and the people who want equality are the normal feminist

The original point of feminist was to be equal, but in todays society, the Modern “woke” people want to be superior ,
they don’t seek the same goals as traditional feminist, so I like to call them “modern feminist”"
ded 🤣
"Lmaooooo, you put it into words"
" @supposedlyaperson2168  

""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win” originated with Mahatma Gandhi"
This is the best comment I’ve ever seen
" @DemonsCrest1  I haven't seen any fighting going on, the whole point is to avoid that"
That’s an insult to Heath Ledger’s Joker!
"Not necessarily easier. The problems women face in dating are clearly different from those of men, but there's a reason they're more scared of who they could date than the men are."
 @regisglass5464  In the first world it's undeniably easier.
PERFECTLY well-said
​ @regisglass5464  How can you say that women don't have it easier in dating?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  Simple, just be wrong."
"I don’t think dating is easier for women. It might be easier for a woman to find a date or get into a relationship, but that ignores the quality of the relationship itself."
Have you not seen men getting attacked in streets from other men? Do you think men walk safely in streets without having no attacks from other men?
 @cjng7340  I never said men don't get attacked.. I said they have a smaller chance of getting attacked
"@regisglass5464

Just because women feel that way, doesn‘t mean it‘s legit. There are plenty of reasons for men to be afraid, but they simply aren‘t (on average) because of their different personality."
 @DavidW-ng5zv literally no one has it easier in dating. It depends on what partner u end up with. And being rejected is not “having a hard time” it just means they didn’t want you and that’s not a bad thing.
"​ @KSull6736 lol no, women have it easier!!"
"Yup. He seemed to realize that too, but a little too late."
"Derrick isn't even remotely representative of what the MRM wants. In fact, a part from Kursat I don't think any of them were MRAs. Zach is more of a conservative who's worried about men's role in society. He's clearly religious and seems motivated by this.
""Real"" MRAs though actually oppose all manners of gender roles across the board. They have zero interest in ""going back to the past"" and actually agree with feminists when it comes to equal treatment regardless of sex. I'm not an MRA myself but I have read a lot of their literature and it's really disappointing to see how they weren't represented in this video AT ALL. Derrick especially is a sad troll who'll give the MRM an even worse reputation than they already have."
 @MoviezGames  This is actually a good insight. Thanks for this. It would have been cool to hear more of what MRA actually stands for because from the video it seemed like the three men didn't really have a solid ground of what they would define as MRA --so it was difficult to understand their side especially the incel hahahaha.
" @mikaelatagaylo8765  Those interviews are called the ""raw files"" btw."
" @mikaelatagaylo8765  IMO that's probably because MRA is heavily based in being reactionary toward feminism. It's not about men, but about fighting against feminism."
"Mens rights and Incels have nothing to do with each other for the most part, that feminist propaganda has been going on since eliot rogers"
Other than bias by the system though (that was created by patriarchy) like with family court and custody battles (which yes there’s a huge bias and it’s not right) but men don’t get touched as regularly in a gas station while trying to get a snack. Like besides the family court rights that men should have on the same level as women of course but besides that and a select few other system biases what rights don’t they have or what rights do they have that are just brushed off by society? Like dude women who are crazy feminists are literally crazy just like crazy republicans are just crazy you can’t just assume every feminist is like the ones online or the ones in the “news” you have to be on the really really bad side of something or the really really good side to be in the news. Like I mean wanting it to be the 50's again is one thing but that’s not a movement that has to do with the generalization of “men’s rights”. There’s bias for women and men in many different situations but wanting it to go back how it was in the 50's just isn’t going to happen. And he knows that. That’s why he gave up. Regardless if you think it’s oppression or not in the 50's among men and women it isn’t going to happen.
Muskaart he’s just spitting straight facts
"Bro you say im hungry and them girls be like fuck off you get to the kitchen and make you're self a sandwich 

Me: wtf"
 @mikaelatagaylo8765  the asian dude did a follow up on his YT channel.
" @MoviezGames  derrick is a perfect example of what MRM is, selfish naive and hates modern women, he wants old privilages what men had in the past. This is MRM. It ignores solutions on mens problems and just wants a backlash on feminism instead."
Truuueee
He’s never gonna smash
"@solo ist wow terrible, where do you hear that? who was that MRA?"
exactly
Derick is super
and he slowly acknowledges it throughout the video
ygm :)
" Shark S.  It actually was NOT funded by MRAs. That's a lie pushed by the MSM that she has debunked numerous times. She also made 3 extremely pro-feminist movies beforehand. There's also loads of footage of her prior to her conversion and you can clearly see she WAS an outspoken feminist.
So you've managed to lie several times in your short little comment. It's clear to me that you're just looking for reasons to defame her,  rather than being open-minded and honest. Try harder."
 @MoviezGames  lol I think part of it was Zach trying to save Derrick
" @Cewlbeans  Feminism brought us the Tender Years Doctrine, not ""patriarchy."""
ya boi What were the points he didn’t get to make? How are women not benefiting from a society that is progressing away from tradition?
Loo
EVERY SINGLE WORD YOU'RE RIGJTKSKKAKAK
Derrick wouldn't know how to dig a hole if you gave him a shovel
" @MoviezGames  yep, when none of them turned forward for toxic masculinity I knew for sure they ain't MRAs"
 @aliasuser_  B/c toxic masculinity does not exist.
"He’s digging his own grave with his mouth, and watching him do it is the most aggravating thing."
 @SelphieFairy  feminism should be fought in the west.
 @JonatanCarmiOK  👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
THANK YOU
" @MoviezGames  Exactly,this is a perfect insight of what MRM really is!"
" @lachusity  this is the problem. Derrick is in fact bad person, but he is not representative of mrm. Mrm is not about oppressing other gender, their goals are like feminists', to reach gender equality. Mra could be feminist"
" BubTheJittGod124  just because they could only come up with two examples on the spot doesn't mean that more examples in real life don't exist. MRA never became a thing until people started using against Feminism. It's a reaction to Feminism becoming more popular and accepted, just like Blue Lives Matter was a reaction to Black Lives Matter."
"“Do you have any empathy”

Derrick: Yes Yes

Me: You clearly don’t."
Yes but he’s still young he’ll learn.
 @MoviezGames  well alot of their supporters arent like what you just said
But sadly ppl like him won’t shutup…… I would skip pass him but I feel like I would be missing other peoples opinions
“Going back to the last wouldn’t be so bad” 💀
"hes a legend, love you derrick"
he’s something else
yes cause he cant dig into any other holes by merit alone
Every single time he speaks he digs deeper lol
Well I'm with derrick he's just being truthful and the feminists are just getting butthurt but the truth is hurting their feelings.
same with some feminists ngl
 @thatstuff3110  ong
​ @RoddyPipersCorneas  😂 a plant
"And without his presence, I think a far more productive discussion would have been had. I also get the suspicion that it was intentional. They knew all the focus would be on this guy instead of Zach who is obviously a mature and intelligent guy and made some great points."
 @MrBastilleDay  He was in another video about incels so if that isn't a testament to his character. I don't know what is.
Dude wasn’t even ~ trying ~ to listen. Absolutely no respect from him
Yeah and the other guy to I forgot his name and i don't give a fuck. The only dude who was genuinely interested and cool was the asian guy asking question and just trying to educate himself good dude
" @vrexxpotvin9304  nah the fella with the cool accent was trying to have a discussion as well, man came prepared with statistical evidence instead of anecdotal which made him come off as ""uncaring"" I guess. Derrick was hilariously out of his depth tho."
 Bruh Bruv  welcome to the human race buckaroo.
his smirk made my blood boil
yall acting like Derrick was the only disrespectful person in this video since we can see that 2/3 of women there were more disrespectful and refused any sort of middle ground and took offense instead of educating themselves and they got exposed throughout the vid however solely picking derrick just bc he's a dude is showing bias here.
 @federicocostas9533  We don't hate Derrick because he's a dude. He just so happens to be a dude who is absolutely despicable.
Erin Sweeney don't ever apologize for speaking your truth. 👏🏻
"@Charlie Baskerville you're right, and telling me to ""stfu"" is just as problematic. I respect what you have to say, I ask the same in return."
Yes someone throw Derrick jerkman back to first grade where we learn respect
" @federicocostas9533  A valuable discussion is built around how to reach middle ground after an individual or a group of people (in this case women) have been violated, time and time again. It is systematic therefore not something a 20 minute conversation provides enough space to ""resolve"" in a way that feels neat and tidy."
 Bruh Bruv  ??? Are you a troll?
Derrick is awesome
 @MrBastilleDay  i liked that when zach didnt know what toxic masculinity was he asked nicely and stayed quiet so he could learn. unlike derrick smh
" @dont8038  that is your opinion, you’re certainly entitled to it and I’d back you up on that score. But I have to disagree."
 @Gentapi5  I'd be concerned if he wasn't
Many people in comments have complained about him but I agree he was a jerk. THere are respectful wayds to disagree without attaavking the otherside as people instead simply focuses on their views and calmly discussing how you differ is much more convincing persuasive nad honourble
anthony acosta i laughed so god damn hard
Lmao
"That’s really closed-minded of you, anthony."
"Lzb Lmvm fam we absolutely have rough in some areas but we have it extremely easy in other areas both genders have things going for and against em, don’t act like it’s all one sided cause it’s not"
"Lizmar Rodriguez involuntary célibataire, I think. Célibataire is French for single."
"Lzb Lmvm dint say that to have an argument with you, you either know these things or you don’t, or you chose not to know about these problems, so I’ll just leave it at that , have a nice day mate"
" @aiwash2766  he did? You can't. ""Find it out on your own"" is a cop out"
 Lzb Lmvm  found another one
anthony acosta Right! It's almost as if he says he's an incel in job interviews as well hm
"Why are people so intolerant of incels? They deserve sympathy. It's like hating on homeless people. Sure, some are dicks and sure some made bad decisions and they are homeless because it's their own fault, but a lot of homeless are just regular decent people who had some really bad luck and are in a tough situation through no fault of their own."
"Just found a video about Derrick on this* channel called I'm an Incel ask me anything. I'm commenting on a bunch of replies cause I feel like everyone would want to watch it. I haven't seen it yet, I had to let every one know about it first lol."
" @Hannah-tp3fl   Jolie Oof  it's on this channel, Jubilee. I mean this, not his, sorry about that. It's fixed now. I never noticed that, so thank you"
 Angry Egalitarian  facts
derrick just committed suicide because of all the hate he got... rip
 @umamifan  is there an article for that I wanna see
 @umamifan  wait fr??
 @umamifan  hopefully thats true
" @khaledbayado6983  yea he did commit sucide , there’s a video on his channel about “ if you see this it means I’m dead “ and multiple other videos 🤷🏽‍♀️"
 @nyree9370  whats his channel name
 @khaledbayado6983  BrendioEEE
 @somnosultanate4314  sis calm down
"yes, but also no lol. they brought in a spokesperson for the movement, yes? regardless of the fact that his views are incredibly skewed and outright insulting, he claims to be a men's right activist, affiliates himself with the movement and represents a subdivision of the movement as well you know."
Wasn't that because she was asked to give details about how she was assaulted? Why would she be happy after she gave the details?
" @braulioreyes9851  She interrupted them, called names, and made low blows. Derrick needs to seriously work on himself for a while."
 @braulioreyes9851  she also didn't acknowledge the issues of men when Kursat talked about the family court thing by directing the problems to something completely different so that made her look ignorant as well. She in my opinion relied more on her experiences and feelings than facts and logic and having a civil discussion.
" @braulioreyes9851  She assumed he was ""invalidating"" her experiences...When he not once said they were invalid. He truly seemed like he was just asking out of curiosity. She got a little defensive and hostile at that. Which would have been granted, had he truly been malicious."
 @miraculoussimpson6785 she literally went “and I agree with that” wdym??
" @Lina-we6fr  just because she said a sentence of “I agree with that” doesn’t mean she didn’t brush on many statements made by the men. I’m not saying I agree with the men but 2 of those women weren’t there for discussions but rather to just pour out their experiences
(Side note: the one who said “that I agree with” is the middle girl and we’re not talking about her, she was probably the only civil one there)"
"I feel like the other two men are also like ""we don't claim this dude he on his own"""
 Tim Evans  you think everyone who disagrees with you is problematic.
"Hiro360 just because two things coincide doesn’t mean they’re connected. That person can disagree with something and it can be problematic. In fact, that’s probably why he disagrees with it."
"Lol
Yes"
Tim Evans then you should be protesting loudly all 3 feminist panelists...
Not even just Feminists
" Tim Evans  they weren't sexist. They explicitly said women and men are equal but different,  everyone except Derrick stepped out."
 @Public-pc4pe  that asian dude also didnt step into the circle
"Well alesya just want a respect and zach doesn't care, derrick and the list guy take the initiative to listen a 'little' not much. The opening discussion when they talk about making offspring absolutely anger me, when they vision is still women have to be women and taking care of their children."
" @elzashinta753  
Men dont use women for breeding, its a necessity and need.
well men cant breed on their own and mostly women (mothers especially) can nurture, teach the child the 'good behaviour' and to respect the authority. Atleast thats what I've observed in myself and about everyone around me.."
" @Shaaan  maybe we live not in the same generation, the idea that I have to take care and nurture my child alone is hell. I rather work and do something fun than be a slave to someone that maybe I don't love anymore in 10 years. But again that my opinion, I rather don't have a child than raising it alone"
" @1234Tsukichan  afterwards he explained that he thinks men and women do need to have equal rights, but need differences in certain aspects because they are physically and mentally different (with the exceptions in mind). What he didn't mention but is quite self explanatory is that those individuals who are exceptions can still have the same rights just don't need the exclusive gender based treatment most others might have."
 @ultimate.tobi.3609  One of them tried to argue nurse should be a women job only.
 @legrandliseurtri7495  i never said I agree with him. That's his opinion. How does this concern me?
 @elzashinta753  then don't have children or get married. Simple
" Tim Evans  how are men's rights problematic? I get Derrick (I'm not gonna bash him for it), but not Zach or the other guy (who was the one who brought in facts)."
" @ultimate.tobi.3609  I still want to get married though for my physical need 🤣, and yes that what I'm saying I don't want to have children can't u understand what I'm writing. There's exception tho if my partner hella rich or can taking care of our children 24/7. Because some women don't have this nurture and kind standard they judge but it's different with men if they don't nurture and kind to their children people say that's fine.... And I'm here screaming WTH double standard"
😂😂dont we love derrick
They chose the worst of both sides
The Venom sweatshirt definitely helped
Who is he then?
Daniela what will that prove
Yuuup
yes
Damn dude 👌
"Lol, me"
😂😂
Yea I was just like... I know how this is gonna go and what he’s gonna say.
Nijat Aliyev who is
So nearly 1.5 k people judged by his looks
ME LMAO
JEatoaol yeah.. he literally compared woman to children.. saying they need to be protected by males
Not sure you understand what a psychopath is if you consider him one... He's just a strange damaged guy
" @TheLunahaven  when it comes down to defending themselves without some form of force multiplier, yes. the woman in the video admitted it themselves, if a creep decided to fuck a woman up, either a man or a bullet is gonna stop him"
As someone with ASPD we don’t claim him. We politely pass him to the BPD’s.
This is actually a game called “Guess the Sexist”
everyone making fun of Derrick is my therapy its so funny
I love that Derricks only description of himself is incel
my man really just said “i’m an incel”
uugghh i wish i were there to share my input!
"I wish I was able to speak from a woman's perspective on men's rights. There were so many things the guys could have touched on and started to but did not follow through like I'd hope. The women also started to use manipulative language, which should have been shut down. Such a let down in conversation."
😮I love Jubilee social groups
The moment Derrick said “I’m also known as an incel.” I immediately was just like “Oh no...”
cant believe derrick studied evolutional biology and still isn't educated
"What do a group of women talk about when they talk about men? Do they just talk about all of their positives and talents of all men or do they have ""locker room talk""?"
"at 15:00 we hear about the bias in the family court system, but just a few minutes prior he said women are superior and more adept to child rearing.. which one is it?"
"“Hi am derrick, im a youtuber”

Me: oh yea this is gonna be good"
"Derick is funny af😂
There should be a series title ,, Dericks Opinions''"
What i love most about these videos is that they just take random people of opposing ideologies and beliefs who probably won't really listen to each other and just plop them in the same room and let them create enjoyable content lol
"""What if your best friend was a woman?"" 
Derrick: laughs awkwardly"
"16:50 - What is wrong with this woman? She claims that there are feminist organisations that work for women, but she can't even name one such organisation, or even a person who works in such organisations, and yet she calls the person asking her about it a ""dude"" and so aggressively. In general, these feminists raised my blood pressure ... every single thing they said was totally racist and ham-handed ... from the very beginning I didn't hear a single argument that would change my mind about feminists."
The camera cuts to Alyshea’s face every time Derrick spoke
"+ I know some of the best pizza places in town
- Oh cool do you have their names?
+ i said i didn't bring a list, dude!"
"“When you hear the word ‘feminism’, what comes to mind?”
“Marxism?” 

Dude, those are not even remotely related."
"There's right, there's wrong, and there's Derrick."
Okay Bruv well there’s 2 of the feminist sexist and 1 male sexist from what I see.
It’s Derrick
Okay bruw Why can't you give awards in YouTube
@Nothing to see over here where
"@Nothing to see over here I only see one, and 2 femal sexists"
I love your pfp! Is it from I love Yoo? :)
Meiron Mussie  soushi is best boi
Which feminist is not sexist among these?
Derrick?
Nothing to see over here how so? how are they sexist?
" @dogwithacamera2722  Idk, man. The women kept clarifying that it wasn't all men. And then the men were like ""women should be the caretakers. But also, why do women get custody of the kids?? It's baffling!"""
Logan Howlett other way around buddy
 @ultrabigfella  yellow and gray shirt dude sexist
 @panicwithcompulsion  the only male that brought up about the legal system didn't even mentioned about females being caretakers
Derrick
Its all he is
"and a ""youtuber"" but hes has like a couple thousands subs and dosent even upload lol"
incel is someone who cant find love due to making himself unable to
 @skelt6578  An incel can be an incel for several reasons. Like explaining a word everybody already understood
Damn roasted himself
His feet can’t touch the ground
 @unknownuser9715  what's his yt??
 @unknownuser9715  what’s his channel
isabella what dose incel mean?
Yeah he was on their other video where they asked him questions about being an incel
I'm an incel lol I have dated woman 8 and up only
@Soviet Astartes derrick actually would be decently attractive if he got off the computer and out of the house and washed his hair a little more. heaps of women LOVE curly hair
"isabella it’s basically someone who only views women as a sexual object, not as a human being."
isabella that’s when I was like bruh
Soviet Astartes That’s basically a male butterface. Do they have a have fun name for that?
Insert Jontron saying oh no
as soon as i saw him i knew and when he admitted it i let out an audible sigh
The moment I saw your profile picture I knew I had finally seen everything
"He was so proud of saying it and he shouldn't be, lmao."
It explains a lot of inner frustrations. He needs to try some mediation or healthy ways of being at peace inward. His outward angst is showing.
"Yes, exactly.  When he said he was an incel, I was ""Oh ok, so there's some sexual frustration involved."""
"He is educated in Biology, doesn't mean he isn't educated."
HiddenOcelot dude how so? Intelligence is using the knowledge you know to acquire new knowledge and applying to problem to finding solutions. Also the ability to learn.
Definitely locker room talk
lmaoo
😂😂
I don’t know who Derrick is but I think
And an incel
PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT HIS CHANNEL IS
😂😂
 @Neroshy  it’s called BrendioEEE
 @rell6837  oh.. It's even worse than expected
 @MasterTopHat  the inceñ dude
Derrick: I am a proud iNcEL! Me: oh lord...
😂😂😂😂😂i was confused by him
Bruh
derrick is like what’s a friend
I got hurt when he said that because im a boy and all my best friends are girls many view me as weak and think im gay this really hurts i cant just enjoy myself without being judged
" @soggytoast6282  trust me man in a couple years all the guys would wish they'd be like you. You know. Derrick's probably just got rejected by a girl, so he hates all of them u know. Trust me you're way better off being comfortable around them and the ppl that make you feel gay are just jealous cuz they are too awkward to talk to women"
" @ronanhannon1951  , You gave Soggy bad advice there.. It's a safe bet to say all his 'Girlfriends' use him as an emotional tampon when they cry to him about the badboys pumping and dumping them.. They also keep him around cause of the free attention and validation he gives them as well. Two things any real man/boy worth his salt should NOT give a girl. He's a 'friendzone' hanger on to these 'Girlfriends' and nothing more.. = They don't respect him.  Those that call Soggy weak call him that cause he IS weak."
 @samsmith2506  YIKES 😬😬 i can tell u haven't had a lot of girlfriends
" @ellia9976  , Everything i said was FACTS and you know it."
" @samsmith2506  as a woman with guy friends i can confirm the last time i cried was at least 5 years ago and i wasn't ""crying into their ""shoulder tampons"""
" @ellia9976  , Yeah right.. Next you're gonna tell me none of these 'guy friends' of yours want you sexually right? That you don't keep those that you know DO want you that way but don't have the GUTS to say it around just because it's to your advantage in terms of getting attention, favors, validation etc..

:Eye roll:"
"​ @samsmith2506  This sounds an awfully too specific for you not to be a guy who just stays around sad wanting to date every woman who is remotely kind to you. Despite people like you existing there are actually guys who just want to be friends with woman, and woman who don't just want to cry on every guy's shoulder. I understand this must be shocking to you, but if you want to live your entire life refusing to be friends with any woman because your worried ""they might not want to date me!"" then be my guest."
" @soggytoast6282  Same here man, I’ve developed thick skin from that, however it is the topic of man toxicity again. I find my female friends are a lot more supportive of me and I love that. I found that if your able to joke about life in general, and find the beauty in it, it gets easier. Don’t be afraid to talk about the way your feeling."
 @samsmith2506  It all depends on what kind of people his friends are.
" @ellia9976  So true, @Sam Smith is just one of the many guys who just isn’t able to comprehend being friends with a girl, I try and see this through his 18th century eyes, but even though I am a guy I can’t see women the way he sees them."
 @ronanhannon1951  You got a point
 @soggytoast6282  I’m sorry that’s your experience. My boyfriend had a similar experience because his friends were always girls and his dad would tease him about being gay. When I met him though I didn’t get that at all and I actually got really drawn to him because of how easy it was for us to talk. We are now 3 years into our relationship and I’m so thankful I found a man like him. So don’t let other people’s opinions bring you down and keep being yourself. One day you’ll make someone very lucky.
" @samsmith2506  who hurt you? You don’t think men are valuable enough to be genuinely seen and be cared for as human beings by women? So you think men are only useful to women as attention givers and shoulders to cry on? That’s so disgusting & untrue. Please think about why you think this way, whoever taught you that did great disservice to your psyche."
 @samsmith2506  everything ellia said was  “FACTS” as well
 @votevermin2072  ... Yeah.. Facts for people OK with being in the friendzone when they don't want to be cause they don't have the guts to tell the truth to the other person.
@Ronan Hannon if you noticed he was saying an example and the woman was portrayed as a stranger and because he’s a boy he just said he had a boy as a friend “for example” he’s laughing because she skipped over the fact that he was referring to the woman as a stranger. And the boy as his friend. And she got really defensive when he mentioned that his friend was a boy
 @samsmith2506  that is honestly like the most ignorant comment I’ve heard today
" @votevermin2072  , You would say that since you're a Woman... Ho humm."
 @samsmith2506  don’t reflect your ignorance towards my gender
 @samsmith2506  the heterosexuals are at it again
 @Alexplayz-jy2es  literally who said that?
"Why don't we all leave sam alone he's obviously 13 and has 1 experience with a girl that turned out bad. Hopefully he matures and if not he'll just end up alone like Derrick, no big deal u know. Also don't use him as a reason to hate men. We don't claim him"
 @samsmith2506  man chill I'm not trying to shame you. just pointing out reasons why you might feel the way you do. Do you wanna talk man? It seems you've got alot of hate for ppl that have never wronged you. If u want we can have a chat in dms or sum and it'll make you feel better about it
" @ronanhannon1951  , ""just pointing out reasons why you might feel the way you do.""

=You are making WRONG assumptions about me to shame me to the others.. I'm just pointing THAT out.  You assume i 'hate' people just because I'm standing my ground here? Step off with that nonsense. Now how about trying to refute my points."
 @ronanhannon1951  how do you know he got rejected by a girl that might not be the case
 @ronanhannon1951  omg thank you this really made me more confident
 @lesleyvalencia6222  tysm for helping em feel better
 @soggytoast6282  Ronan is sooooo right! I had a guy best friend who was like that in high school but I was super shy to ask him out cause I didn't know if he had a crush on one of his girl friends that he was close with. I never asked lol but now I kinda wish I did just to find out cries
"The only intimacy he has received from a woman is his mother's. The only ""friends"" he has is on the internet."
" @soggytoast6282  Ik this might sound like I'm promoting emotional suppression, but if their opinions aren't physically infringing on your ability to live the life you want, then you should not feel obligated to GAF about them, or anyone else in the comments. Or even me. Your mind is what you make it. Talk to your friends about it if you need to."
 @samsmith2506  you surely are the one who is weak here not soggy toast
I would love to hear about what you think of feminists. It would be very interesting to hear your opinion. 😀👍
Derrick should not be included in this because his beliefs could be a whole video on its own.
"Capacity to do work and achieve desired outcomes is the only metrics that matters. The difference are biological, but beyond that, there should be equality of the sexes. No ifs, ands, or buts!"
"Honestly, these discussions suck.  The prompts are often strange,  and they never really get into the issue. As soon as two people start to really get into it we hear thr wid block tick and we switch to a new prompt. Why watch this if they cut it off as soon as there is a discussion?"
i can’t tell if derricks hair is wet or just greasy
"there's no such thing as a ""gender wage gap."""
"Derrick: starts talking
Feminists: So you have chosen death"
i love all the women’s expressions whenever derrick talks
im covering my drink around derrick
You guys need to have a fella like me on there for discussions like this.
"I feel like every time Derek spoke, the other men were just like “oh god”"
"This is how every question ends up:
They have a civilized conversation, Derrek speaks, and then it becomes chaos."
There is no way Derrick was serious he had to be trolling smh
Ngl Derrick is talking in the worst way to get his point across
post switched for my personal amusement
Kursat was extremely effective in this debate
"I know everyone’s talking about how they don’t like how Derek was in the video, but Mimi was also getting on my nerves to"
Try to find a comment that does not mention Derrick.
"Derrick shouldn't have been there, all he did was push the conversation back about 10 steps every time he opened his mouth"
"I'm sorry, but this ranting argument by the feminist at 15:19 is just textbook sexism. 
She explained like 3 bad experiences with men. That DOES NOT mean that all men are involved. No matter how much you dislike or disagree with these three men here, none of them were her attackers... So why are MEN the issue here? THOSE men can be bad without ALL men being bad. I know A LOT more than 3 men that are perfectly respectful to women..

When it comes to race, sex, or anything, do not judge an entire group based on the actions of a few. How is this difficult?"
"Its sad but Alyesha ruined this whole debate if it wasn't already up in flames. Like I want to sympathize with her experiences, but she's so unwilling to listen and understand ANY opposing views to her own I just can't. Everyone hating on Derrick despite him just being a bit of a dork, but Alyesha may as well been spitting venom every other sentence."
Pacific Fire His beliefs were very interesting to hear.
It was a video.
Uncle Ruckus you are 102% balck
"Search for ""I'm an incel. Ask me anything"", and you get a whole video of him :P"
Pacific Fire IM WHEEZING
Hannah Johnson definitely greasy 🤮🤢🤢
Hannah Johnson all three

Everything about that guy is greasy.

Canadian Goose LMAOOOOO
Stan Nct definitely greasy
Both
Canadian Goose lmaoo

Nicolas Castaneda Well he deserves it but it was hilarious
Derrick: Peace was never an option
Chosen a lonely death.
Lol ikr
Lmfaoo Yes!🤣
Yasss👍😂👍
They said:😐😒
what kinda of fella are you just curious
What are you like
What did he say that was so bad
Orkney Mgtow almost everything
 @orkzin  literally everything
He doesn’t represent what the other men were arguing for
" @jasonshuman619  I don't agree with the patriarch thing, but I think the minute he said he was an incel, people made up their minds about him"
"I dont think he's that bad, a little misguided about certain things but I do feel it mostly has to do with his upbringing."
So true
"Yeah, also why was he there? He didn't agree with either of the other males, with that, the other two males i do think belonged there. was he there because this is youtube?"
I really wanna like your comment but it’s at 69.
 @sulfur_americium2993  u can like now lol
Not chaos ... Syndrome!!
like number 609
Derrek speaks and then I wonder why he is even allowed in the conversation
I agree he has a good point  but he represents it in the worst possible way
WeirdOo some parts of his points are things I just can’t agree with you should check out the video of him being asked questions on this channel and you’ll see he really believes that women belong in the kitchen and should just take care of baby’s and never really develop a career or social life and I just can’t agree with that you know
Damn that's harsh
Lzb Lmvm not all of it some of it is absolutely bullsh*t like men can’t man spread or stuff like that but there’s also stuff like big corporations making young attractive females do sexual favours for a job or promotion. It’s like war between the sex’s but the biggest mistake people make about war is blaming only one side.
Decipoint youtuber vocab 101
xilliam what
I think quite the opposite
Young Batter Offical in what way?
"They don't need to, we have this comment section."
THIS video could've been called that.
Feminists and MRAs would just team up to say that Derrick is a straight-up misogynist....because he is 🤣
" @josenotmarichan  I don’t know what Derek’s thought process was, but he just created a whole new side that contradicts MRA and Feminism"
they made a video called “i’m an incel ask me anything” & it’s pretty much everyone disagreeing with derrick for 10 minutes straight
" Luís Andrade  idk if anyone really changed their minds, but it was interesting to see things from his pov :)"
"Derrick vs the world, Derrick meets world"
More like Derrick vr Alesha
More like Derrick vr Aleysha
"Women: we have karen
Men: we have Derrick 🌹"
 @josenotmarichan  How?
I couldn't agree more
LMAO
Not particularly. He basically just said feminism is wrong and doesn't help men. Which is ironic because he kept ignoring the MRAs saying men are inherently worse parents while the feminists opposed this.
"​​ @DavidW-ng5zv  if so, then why are the MRAs saying men are lesser parents per biology while the feminists oppose this? Which helps foment fatherhood?"
​​ @regisglass5464  why does feminism preach against the family unit?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's odd, why would MRAs stating men are lesser parents create a healthy family unit?"
Rip there is one right under you about the woman talking about sports (sorry i forgot her name)
3 in a row after I scrolled down from here... daym...
Jere Maya’s is not Derek-related.
Too hard
He’s such a smooth brain
The pinned comment lol
i gave up
This
You're reading one right now!
" @quentinmfbradley  
i get that😂"
I found one 👆🏾
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Me
You
"Boom, found it!"
Me too m8
"Most MRA and feminists fights for equality and MRA just want men problems to get solved too, along with the women problems. 
There are many feminist too who are misandrists and just want men hating and ignores men problems and mra are just against them.
Tag does not matter. 
We should help both genders instead of fighting that who is better or who suffers more, we should for equality and HELP all genders. 
I am true feminist and true mra."
Damn bleach ...you have been hiding out since March. WTF????
There’s one above you
"and that's the point. what bode lang's video Faking Authority, Destroying Merit"
Couldn't have put it better myself
Thats why im glad he was there lmfao
I don't really like when she said that why do men need a men's rights org
Yeah I didn't really like ene she was questioning why men need a men's rights group
Derrick is never getting a girlfriend.
"Derick: finding a girl is hard
Also derick: why would I be friends with a woman?"
"my girl was like ""i specifically know of womens groups trying to change things for men""  then saying my dude i didnt come with research i cant tell you who is just straight lying"
"Derrick “men are here to protect you”
Me looking at Derrick: ….. when was last time you even looked at a gym"
Derrick referring himself as an incel in his introduction told me everything I needed to know about him right away
I wish they had a male feminist and a female men’s rights
Who tf invited Derrick💀
can’t get over how done the three women look every time Derrick talks
They should have gotten a man feminist and a woman men’s rights person rather than just 3 men vs 3 women
"Derick was a very representative part of the men, so let him be. I´m glad they invied him.

I dont agree with what he says or the way he see life, but its important to know there are still people that thinks like this."
"5:46 of course, they will agree. These are born for these"
I love how you can see the feminists trying to stop themselves from punching Derrick in the face
I'd like to see a male feminist vs male right advocate
"5:12 ""I just want you not to harm me. I can protect myself"" 
What was that 😂
If nobodies harming you, why there will be any need to protect 😂"
the look on everyones faces whenever derrick spoke 💀
"""-Sometimes finding a girl at all is hard.""





For him I can see why..."
"This is why women aren't taken seriously ""I know that you came with your research or whatever "". Embarrassing."
"Zach asked a question and got yelled at, she could’ve just answered the question."
Derrick is everything that’s wrong in this society
Most comments are about how much they hate Derek and I’m living for it
Or a boyfriend or a non binary partner
Or a frogfriend
The fact that he said it’s easier for women to find a man than for men to find a woman just showed how much no one wants him
melanie chiriacescu it’s true tho
Amen!
" @nosferat5395  no it's not lmao, just because women often reject you dosent mean women have it easier."
"Avasti often rejects me? Dude, i’m good looking, it’s not about that and it’s not about me, i’m talking in general, just use your brain for a moment. Just look it up, on average, how many texts a girl receives in one day from guys VS how many texts a guy receives in one day from girls. You’ll understand what i mean."
Rotația lui Dumnezeu it’s really isn’t true
"Rotația lui Dumnezeu i see where you’re coming from fellow Romanian ahah we do get more texts so technically it will be easier for us to find a man. The issue is to find a good man, someone we are attracted to, have common interests and stuff. I wouldn’t say it’s easier for us to find someone because most of the guys who text us are even absolute weirdos, guys who just want sex or guys we aren’t attracted to"
@schanna muliyil true
 @melaniechiriacescu7876  no your just wrong and indulged with the attention various women get many likes from men but women are picky so they don't choose first person they see so when the person they choose says no they say it's harder but you got like 10 other guys who want you but women make the wrong choice and blame men
Yep he can eat cheese balls in his moms basement.
Mylesthe Goat Ikr it’s just logic
Women and men cannot be just friends. It is against nature
" @hannah-7525  Um, what? As a woman have no problem being friends with a man. Although for a man, it’s difficult for them to have a friendship with a woman."
" @autumnperez6232  men and women cannot be friends because they are opposites. It usually ends up being something sexual/romantic. If not, you’re not actually “friends” you’re more acquaintances."
 @hannah-7525  lol no
 @hannah-7525  tell that to the three male friends I had in elementary school.
 @elliel4736  look deeper into it and from a third perspective. Put your emotions aside and accept the natural truth. Men and women cannot be friends. It is against nature to think otherwise.
 @hannah-7525  what third perspective are you talking about?
 @hannah-7525  what I'm saying is that I have had many friendships with males that have not turned romantic.
" @elliel4736  underlying feelings most likely there from one of the sides, if not both."
@rachel martinez yeah actually no there are always exceptions like everywhere in anything in life but if over 95 believe that no man dont think its possible. If you don’t believe ask any guy you know or text them to come over see what happens
 @hannah-7525  I'm bisexual. Does this mean I can't be friends with men and women?
 @hannah-7525  Your joking right...
 @hannah-7525  ...I'm a girl friend with a guy. We both see each other as sibling/best friend. It not that hard. Not everything in life are romance. It like you choose the story of how you wanna live.
Derrick knows what's up
 @hannah-7525  how???
 Jeffrey Epstein  r/nice guy vibes LMFAO or maybe we just want friends that are not the same gender as us? yall reaching 💀
" @hannah-7525  I believe by your logic I can’t be friends with anyone because I’m Omnisexual, I like all genders. Can I not have friends in general then?"
 @blaie6965  keep coping
 @hannah-7525  welp I better go through a breakup with all my friends oh wait should I consider them friends I don’t want to have all of  my straight female friends to like me in the wrong way
@Awa Correa keep coping
" @elizabethmurphy1351  besides, you literally proved my point that male/female friendships are sexual and based on your appearance lmao"
 Jeffrey Epstein  good they’re nothing more
 @hannah-7525  men and women can be friends i hang out with 2 girls almost everyday and i don't see or touch them sexually
" @ryanthehuman1167 , I'm just here to comment on your Percy Jackson pfp. 👍"
 @hannah-7525  gay people and acearos laughing in the background
" @hannah-7525  they can be friends, I'm a guy and my best friend growing up was a female, I never had feelings for her and she never had feelings for me. I had a crush on my guy best friend (I'm pan).... he is my boyfriend now, think again."
" @clarissa7408  same with me, I'm pan 💀💀"
 @jelly_josss2403  EXACTLY!!!
 @lucasselleck4276  frightening
 @lucasselleck4276  let’s be friends
" @clarissa7408  umm, how old are you?"
 @dishawnasmith4793  degenerate behavior has degenerate consequences
 @lucasselleck4276  it was a joke because like we supposedly can’t have friends
" @hannah-7525  that would mean men are naturally attracted to all women and cannot see them for individuals outside of sexual/romantic relationship which idiodic. Besides that's theres tons of scenarios like gay men/women, childhood friends, professional relationships, and family like relationships."
 @beastinout7291  not talking about just men since women are also to blame. Theres always exceptions but in general men and women cannot be “just friends”.
" @hannah-7525  im a girl. i have more guy friends than girl friends, half of my guy friends are in relationships."
" @hannah-7525  so funny 😐😐😐😐😐like, damn bro, you really got me rolling 😐😐😐😐"
 @lucasselleck4276  unfunny. No one is impressed
 @hannah-7525  I never said I was funny
 @hannah-7525  AHAHAHAHA u gotta be kidding me 😂 😂
I think he just meant he can't FIND any girls who want to be his friends idkkk
" @hannah-7525  tf I have female friends, and females have male friends, so clearly they can be friends"
" @1__1734  no? i don't want to hook up with any of my guy friends, i don't want to kiss any of my guy friends, hence them being FRIENDS."
 Lost Soul  r/NiceGuys
"I think it's probably fairly rare for men and women to be close friends, without some extra ""feelings"" from at least one side. I don't doubt that it happens though. It's definitely possible to have friends that you talk to now and then."
" @hannah-7525  I have female friends who I've known for years and it never became romantic. Guess me and a ton of other people around the world are against nature. Oh well, but aren't things like rape, murder, infanticde and tribal genocide also a part of nature? Maybe it shouldn't matter if it's natural or or not because that's an appeal to nature fallacy. There are natural things that are bad and unnatural things that are good too, and this is assuming your premise is even correct as you haven't provided evidence for it, ""look deep into your soul"" doesn't count as evidence."
"​ @hannah-7525  Do you realise that you are making an appeal to nature fallacy? I'm going to assume you haven't heard of it before. Putting aside whether or not it actually is natural or not, for the sake of argument lets assume that it is unnatual. So what? There are unnatural things that are good and make our lives better, and there are natural things that are bad and cause harm. So you argument fails on multiple levels."
" @hannah-7525  Oh Hanna, I would never mind being friends with a guy without having any feelings for them, you want to know why? I'm not attracted to men. I don't think of them as anything other than friends. You forget that there is also gay men who are not attracted to woman so they can be friends with a woman without having any feelings. Understand now?"
 Lost Soul  If you're such a nice guy take rejection better. You're not entitled to sex or a relationship
" @hannah-7525  no honey, not all Men and women Cant be bestie. Since a loooooong time ago, i got a guy bestie, and i was a girl (now im genderfluid), and nothing ruined our friendship at all, both of us also Liked each other (i just caught him). But nothing makes us awkward at all, we are still very close."
" @hannah-7525  yes cause being  lesbian doesn't exist. I am bi so I will fall in love with everyone I meet, so no friends for me then (besides non binary)"
" @1__1734  can confirm, i have a lot of guy friends, they are all like brothers to me and we've never liked each other at all and we never will."
 @clarissa7408  nah mate you can befriend anyone you want it doesn't matter.
 @hannah-7525  i could wear a scarf as a shirt and you wouldn't have a say in it.
 @1__1734  my male bestfreind since childhood has a crush on another girl? and i obviously support him since I've never had feelings for him nor will I ever have feelings for him so I just don't understand but okay?
 @ivanastevanovic9702  yeah exactly because you know him since childhood and the only other possibility would be if one doesn’t find the other attractive and the friendship will never be the same with like the own gender especially later in life.
" @hannah-7525  Okay then,I'm already friends with many girls,so cry about it since your statement ain't stopping anyone"
" @hannah-7525  
That’s not true at all I have a very close friend that’s a dude and we don’t see each other romantically at all."
 @hannah-7525  lmao you are so ridicules
Personally as a women i dont want guy friends idk why but i just don't but thatd just a personal thing u cant just say that generally
 @hannah-7525  So im gay and I have a lot of friends that are women how can our relationship end up sexual or romantic?uh... it doesn't make sense because we are attracted to the same gneder.
"His question is legit, because it was based on context of what he was saying. His central point was, that due to biology, men and women cant be friends. Now, add to that the behavior of ""modern"" women, and yes, why bother?

Its a legit question. As legit as you can get something to be."
IN MY OPINION ok so don't get mad but I think a girlfriend and being friends with someone are two completely different things and again it's my opinion some of you might have other opinions and I would love to hear them
RIGHT
" @hannah-7525  my best friend is a guy and I'm a girl. We hang out every day and have fun. What are we then, enemies?"
 @hannah-7525  Help what😭
" @hannah-7525  Gender doesn't matter, you can be friends with anyone (Except Derrick)"
 @hannah-7525  who said it was??? No one. I have been friends with both male and female. Its not like every time I am friends with a male that it turns romantic or sexual. Im friends with my male cousins and are close to them. That does not mean I feel romantically or sexually attracted to them cause by thr fact they are my cousins and that I don't feel that way towards them. So by your logic you are saying that any opposite gender that you are friends with that it is not a part of nature cause you will feel romantically or sexually attracted to them......including your family members who are the opposite gender as you. Now that is some messed up thinking 😀
 @hannah-7525  Dude what if she's lesbian with a guy friend?
"Search your feelings you know it to be true!
NOOOOO NOOOOO!
(Luke 1977 colorized)"
 @hannah-7525  FACTS
" @hannah-7525   or you are just ""friends"" until it take sexual/ romantic turn down the line"
 @hannah-7525  my bestie is a guy actually…
 @hannah-7525  .....what?
 @hannah-7525  bro im gay they def can
 @hannah-7525  gay ppl exist
 @hannah-7525  explain lesbians being friends then. are they automatically in love? weird for you to assume every single person is straight.
" @delikat6775  Pretty much this, as a bisexual person, I guess I can't have friends xD It's also not hard if you consider the other person well...a real person. My parents also kept opposite-sex lifelong friendships, before they got together and after they separated. Saying you can't be friends with the opposite sex means you can't see them as anything else than a potential partner, and that's just sad lmao"
" @elliel4736  

Those aren't men those are kids wtf?!?!? We are talking about adults."
" @hannah-7525  there are countless examples of people of the opposite gender who have been friends for many years, where both parties just want to be friends, not anything more"
Derick based
 @hannah-7525  You are right
" @hannah-7525  then explain a lesbian and a gay being best friends, they won't magically be straight. Also even if they were attracted to the opposite sex they can still be friends. Me and my two guys friends have never had a crush on each other because we like each other platonically-- in case you don't know such a big word, it means as a friend-- and never have liked each other romantically. There are plenty other examples that disprove your theology."
 @hannah-7525  please tell me ur kidding
 @hannah-7525  lmao tell that to my best friend (a boy) and the rest of my friend group
 @hannah-7525  BHAAHAHA DID YOU JUST CALL ME A PICK ME? LMAO
 @hannah-7525  so what you are saying is men are assuming? Thought that was a women stereotype guess I'm weonf
 @hannah-7525  since when?
 @hannah-7525  ummmm your kidding right?!?
 @hannah-7525  guess I’m not aromantic anymore 😟
are u slow
" @hannah-7525  
Then, I guess you would have no guy friends or boyfriend XD"
 @hannah-7525  you definetly don't leave your house
" @hannah-7525  
Women and men cannot be friends? 
You're just saying that to get replies."
 @hannah-7525  ever heard of homosexual
 @jelly_josss2403  exactly lol I think she forgot about homosexual stuff which now has taken over like covid
" @hannah-7525  I’ve never heard of such a thing in my life. Sure, I agree with you to some aspect like the other dude Taimur Ashraf who commented he likes all the girls he was friends with. Yeah it happens buuut it’s a huge presumption to include not just others, but everybody as well when we are all different people who act and think entirely different. The word platonic was created for a reason. It’s true people can and will befriend others that they obviously find attractive, so of course anyone would take advantage of any opportunity to get closer to them or someone they like. But that doesn’t count for everyone since, again I will repeat this because this is important and people tend to forget so easily that we all think and act differently. It’s honestly not hard to comprehend for this should be common knowledge. I dunno about the kind of friendships you have but if you’re assuming every woman that likes men and vice versa thinks the same, then to me, it sounds like you must like or have interest in every guy friend you have. Aye, that’s totally fine if you do, it happens. Though it’s an astonishingly ‘n preposterously narrow minded way of thinking to automatically assume everyone else thinks or is wired the same way you are, dude. 😂💀 I believe you’re entitled to your own opinion but it’s different when you try to speak for the entire world based on your own personal experiences or whoever else you may have talked to or observed. Since ours are not all one in the the same. Besides us that are homosexual, there are also asexuals and aromantics who have no desire or interest for sexual or romantic relationships. Even straight or bisexuals can have platonic friendships with the opposite sex because you’re forgetting another very important fact, which is that humans in general don’t always befriend a person on their attractiveness, but by their personality and shared interests. Which obviously doesn’t have to resort to sexual or romantic feelings. The thing is it’s so easy and quick for one to naturally assume anything when you don’t know fully know all the humans you’re referring to, as in all of us. That’s utterly impossible, bro. 🤣"
I agree with Derick ion fw girls unles it’s sexual
Bro gets no girls for a reason
Also Derrick: why would I wash my hair?
You guys need to stop taking Hannah seriously.💀They don't know what they're saying and their statements are based clearly off of what they think is the stereotype.
Literally 😭 😂
 @1__1734  set your standards higher then 💀 if you’re that desperate that you would just hook up with anyone that’s nobody’s problem but your own. there’s a lot of normal guys out there who can have a friendship w a woman and not have it be romantic or sexual.
 @jelly_josss2403  deadass tho 💀
I have had male/ female freinds my entire life growing up ?
 @hannah-7525  💀
 @hannah-7525  girl wht
 @hannah-7525  wut
 @hannah-7525  how do people fall for bait this bad
"About two things that Zack said:
1.  10:00 about that men shouldn't be nurses. My grandpa was a nurse. He was the first one in the hospital where he worked. Many people said he was a great nurse (he is retired now). Nowadays there are more male nurses in the hospital my grandfather worked at.

2. 14:41 about that boyscouts and girlscouts should be separate. I personally am in a mixed gender scouting and I view it as a safe space and emotional outlet. I would not have been able to have the conversations that helped me and have the great experiences that I had if I hadn't met the people that I met. I wouldn't be able to go to scouting if it was for separate genders (not enough members). 
Disclaimer: I do not want to attack Zach. I just want to add my personal experiences."
" @hannah-7525  I had a guy best friend for 6 years; just because you don’t experience it, doesn’t mean it’s not real."
 @hannah-7525  just because you can't do it doesn't mean it can't be done
Hahah logic yes
@rachel martinez same
 @clarissa7408  periodt-
 @lucasselleck4276  SAME BRO BAHAHAH
 @hannah-7525  tell that to me and best friend of 3 years
 @hannah-7525  ok karen what about gay men or lesbain women? Or what about bisexual individuals?💀
 @hannah-7525  LMAO I’m not even gonna say anything to that it’s just sad you think that way
I think he has the problem I'm I right lmaooo
 @hannah-7525  what if he’s gay
And he wonders why… Lol
 @hannah-7525  What the f????
 @hannah-7525  this is a hilarious take. What about a lesbian who’s friends with men???? Lol
" @hannah-7525  this is legit kinda sad that you feel this way, I hope ur doing OK honestly"
" @hannah-7525  you are right....and you a real one for calling a spade a spade.

Salute"
" @hannah-7525  Excuse me? I've been friends with both women and men since I was a young boy yet still not developed any ""romantic"" feelings for them. Plus, having my friend to be my lover isn't ldeal at all. pretty awkward tbh. For me, Friends would still be and always be friends. Men and women can have such deep relationship together without romantic or erotic interests. Nature? What nature? If it's truly by nature, both men and women probably couldn't even lay their eyes each other for gender differences then? lol"
" @hannah-7525  there are such thing as platonic friendships between men and women. and using your logic, what about lesbian women and gay men? how can it be sexual then?"
"as a woman, I agree with him."
" @hannah-7525  they can, are you ok in the head? Men and women can be friends, my friend fredrick is friends with 20 girls, he is gay but still, it doesn't matter. Also, I'm friends with girls, you saying that is just downright sexist nil"
 @hannah-7525  We aren’t in 19700B.C.E. We don’t wear leaves over our private parts. We are in a civilised 2022 where the main goal in life isn’t to mate and have kids.
"Because being in the friendzone is a bad deal and is also dishonest. I'm not giving up my time, energy, and resources to be just friends I'd rather use those resources on a woman who's Romantically interested. And being a woman's friend is dishonest because men do that in hopes that in a woman's moment of weakness she will sleep him.  Incredibly dishonest."
He’s so weird 😭he wants to have an answer to everything so that he doesn’t look wrong but it just made him look worse
" @hannah-7525  its the most beautiful thing to ever exist. Even if you are friends and besides that the best part its like your spending time with them up until you dont realize that time passed by making memories and seeing that person at a different veiw, a lifes greatest gifts comes with mystery as fate decides and you become aware of who youve been with by time it passes he could be the one you will fall for as for him aswell. Lifes greates gift mmhmm!"
 @hannah-7525  which it is so beautiful!!
@rachel martinez cool. You have a lot of guy friends. I wager that all of them stay in the friendzone because they hope they can get sex one day. That’s not a friend.
" @hannah-7525  I don't feel anything for those male friends, not males in general tho"
 @hannah-7525  All my friends are girls though. Welp guess I dont have any friends despite them helping me go through me getting bullied and through a breakup yes yes makes sense.
 @hannah-7525  Have you seen nature? It’s wild out there. :)
 @elliel4736  hes talking about his third leg Laugh at loud
Like you can’t even spell women without men
" @hannah-7525  no, it isn't wtf"
 @hannah-7525  I can be friends with a guy and nothing Romantic is going with us both
 @hannah-7525  pls stop. lmfao
 @elliel4736  bro are you okay?
why should he be friends with a chic anyway
@rachel nino redflag
 @kantimeowpaw4693  Romance and sex have nothing to do with the other.
 @lucasselleck4276  That's different.
 @peterwallis4288  that's not a friend. That's an acquaintance.
" @kiki29073  not necessarily. I guess it's up to your personal definition. But I think you can be friends with someone without talking to them regularly. I would still consider my high school friends to be my friends, although I don't often talk to them. I think they would consider me a friend. But if you don't agree, I guess that's your prerogative."
 @hannah-7525  Who hurt you?
You can't even spell women without men
" @hannah-7525  wdym bro. Not everything that is to do with girls and boys need to be romanticised wtf?! I hanged out with guys in Primary school and they all chill. It isn’t against nature. What is against nature is to be against each other. Shouldn’t we be supposed to help, not at each other’s throats?"
average discord mod
 @jaydaauzenne7986  what can u not just dateone smh bruh taking over a lot ppl
I am sure he been in the friend zone many times before
" @hannah-7525  How is it against nature? Cats even have friends regardless of the other cat’s gender. You said usually, so there’s still a chance of having an opposite sex friend."
 @hannah-7525  Do you have any friends actually?
 @stinkybananaog101  Ooga booga fan smh
 @fruity_bussy7300   I just wanted to say your Kuroo picture is cute
 @WiseAsSerpentsHarmlessAsDoves  your friends don’t equal the Earths population
 @hannah-7525 literally said no logical person ever. Just say you’re unfaithful. In nature they literally work together to do certain stuff regardless of romantic relationships BFFR 💀
 @hannah-7525 just say you’re a not faithful….. like that may be YOU but tons of women have male friends that are COMPLETELY PLATONIC
 @hannah-7525  how do you define a friendship ?
 @autumnperez6232  it's a huge waste of time for a guy to be friends with women.........most guys just wanna smash
Derrick is correct on both counts.
He actually hates woman despite being attracted to them
 @hannah-7525  I have men friends that never had feelings for me lol it's not against nature it's against your way of viewing things
 @scarlettdracoblack4454  he did say he was an incell no girl likes him.
 @made.in.ja.2250  Only the shallow ones who are intellectually and morally inept.  You are certainly not speaking for most guys!
" @kiki29073 Don't you believe it!  People often disregard the connection, but it is very real, and quite profound!"
 @hannah-7525  W Hannah
 @autumnperez6232  you’re using those men for social status and your own ego …
​ @hannah-7525  LOL
 @hannah-7525  It's possible.
"​ @elliel4736  

Yea, in the elementary school when puberty was hardly in the picture. Real mature bringing up that example... 🤦‍♂️"
 @hannah-7525  said nobody without brain-rot ever.
Pretty sure Derick repels all women in a 1000000000000000000000000000 mile radius
"⁠@Olivia😍😍 As a male I will respectfully disagree. Women may not think about it as much hence the term “friend zone” but men do. Every female friend I’ve had I had feelings for, whether very little or a lot. It is in nature"
 @junkyarddanubis3116  That sounds like a you problem bro. The rest of us have friends of the opposite sex with no feelings 👍🏻
 @MoonageDaydream.  Who said it’s a problem to admire? 😏
He doesn’t even realize that that sort of attitude is why women don’t find him attractive.
 @hannah-7525 so if men and women can’t even be friends then why do they date each other?
 @kantimeowpaw4693  does he tho?
 @hannah-7525 I’m curious about what your opinion on family relations would be. I know several people where their best friend is their sibling of the opposite sex. And can’t you be genuine friends with your parent of the opposite sex?
 @elliel4736 yea elementary school. I personally miss being genuine friends w men. I had lots of male friends up until highschool when a lot of them turned into disgusting fucks who saw me as an inadequate piece of meat bc I wasn’t curvy. Men only choose woman friends if they have other intentions most of the time.
 @hannah-7525 if someone is bisexual does that mean they can’t have friends at all?
"the way he thinks and speaks and looks , no he's not incel , he harvest the fruit of his own actions. He's being punished , and I must say rightfully so. These kind of idiots shouldn't be allowed to breed."
Barret thinking women should be equal as a man isn’t being a simp
Barret don’t use the word simp if u don’t know the meaning to it and in what situation it’s appropriate to use .
Ah yes one of the LEGIONS of female mra's
@Barret 🤡
@Barret no😹❤️
Barret the king of treating women the way they should be treated. you're seeking male validation.
They do just hard to come by
Barret for real 🤣
"Barret wanting equality isn’t simping lmao, at least use the word correctly"
Im a female and I think men’s rights
Why cant we have more equal rights activists?
" @esmepersis351  so you're saying can just pick your sexuality? Way to invalidate the LGBTQ+ community. No, most feminists aren't hypocrites, but you certainly are one"
I’m actually a female and i rather describe myself as a ‘manist’ rather then a ‘feminist’
" @uoutoii6211  The movement is not about equality, it is about superiority. Women are treated better than men in the united states"
"Barret not simping, just advocating for equality between sexes"
Angry Egalitarian they don’t have more rights though and those things you listed aren’t rights
Falkyraizu i’m laughing hahah
"@Barret Hating men is misandry NOT FEMINISM, idc about what others ¨feminist¨ says but hating or thinking women need to be superior to men is misandry"
Barret being respectful towards 49.6% percent of the current human race is “SimPiNg “ so please educate urself ✨
 @falkyraizu3063  feeling superior to men is misandry NOT FEMINISM
" @shinypotatoe  Maybe in your country it doesn't exist a wage gap but here in Paraguay, and Argentina and most South American countries it does exist"
"As a woman, I would love to be on the men's rights side as well as a feminist :)"
"@Barret yall don't know how to use the word simp, thats not it ma dude"
Barret respecting women isn’t simping bruh
Barret respecting women isn’t being a simp
Men rights?
"@Barret no, it's called basic respect."
Barret STOP CALLING MEN WHO TREAT WOMEN WELL SIMPS. THIS IS WHY NOBODY TREATS US WELL.
" @esmepersis351  incorrect, women were actually given the opportunity to vote way before they got the ability to but they denied it because they didn't want to be drafted. They don't put that on men women decided that. Perhaps do your research before you open your mouth"
 @esmepersis351  women who are younger actually make more money have more opportunities to advance then men are the same age so the child support method is outdated but nothing is being done about it
 @esmepersis351  if you actually did any amount of research you would know this but it doesn't fit your agenda so I doubt you will
That would be really interesting.
@Barret bruh can I ask in your mind what is the defination of a simp?
Simp city!  ^_^
"@Barret

Being a feminist isn't being against men.... It's fighting for equality and respect
Feminists are fighting not onlu for women nut for everyone.
They are against genderroles for women AND men"
That is quite relevant
" Leader Mark  real feminists care about men. Like male victims of assault, real ones care about them. Women do not have privilege? Male feminists aren’t simps. Feminism is wanting equality for male and female people."
" Leader Mark  Men do have the right to their children and to get paid child support. 
But how do you believe a man could have an abortion? Do you mean a vasectomy? Or are you talking about trans men? Because I believe they actually do have the right to abortion as much as a woman do."
@Barret clownish
 Leader Mark  that literally makes no sense... come again?
" Leader Mark  feminists DO fight for men. the patriarchy negatively impacts men AND women, despite the fact that it was designed to benefit men. for example, the patriarchy fuels the stigma that “men can’t cry/show emotions”, “man-up” mentality and disregards men’s mental health struggles. the patriarchy makes it harder for fathers to get custody of their kids due to being seen as the breadwinners & mothers being seen as the caretakers. it fuels the attitude that men can’t wear what they want (eg. clothes that we currently consider as feminine) and can’t be weak or show weakness. 
REAL feminists (male & female) fight for men’s mental health to be taken seriously, fight against toxic masculinity & the patriarchy. because that’s the aim: EQUALITY for all sexes and the dismantling of the patriarchy. 
there are female “feminists” who don’t speak up about men’s issues, and there’s men who don’t speak up about women’s issues. but they’re not feminists and aren’t fighting for equality, but don’t generalise an entire movement into something it’s not."
 Leader Mark  men aren’t feminists for female attention. they’re feminists because they believe in equality.
 Leader Mark  nah u do
@Barret or just men who believe in the rights and equality of women. Its that simple
@Barret lol
 @TGLE_YT  Hahah clown emoji so funny😐. Go back to Tik Tok
"feminist is helps both men and women, men's rights only help men"
 @rose-oo7hc  true you are real feminist
@Barret im convinced this is derick with an other account.
@Barret oh honey delete this comment the embarrassment must be consuming you.
Yeah
 @esmepersis351  as an Alabamian this is the one
 @uoutoii6211  YUHH period
 @machielluchtmeijer7796  she didn’t say that- why would someone who hates men be attracted to men? that’s what they’re saying “if i hated men i’d be lesbian” doesn’t mean “i can pick and choose my sexuality”
 @shinypotatoe  u sound like ur pro life
 Angry Egalitarian  they literally just said ur incorrect- which u are they’re not rights it’s just ppl in the court system being biased
 @mollytpwk8507  oml i did not mean to offend you i just thought it was hilarious :)
 @esmepersis351  that’s what I am saying like it’s the comment that sent me
@Barret or they just want equality and is a normal man
" Angry Egalitarian  i do agree that women should be held accountable in terms of prison sentences, drafting, and custody cases, but how can you argue that men SHOULDNT pay child support? if a man gets a women pregnant, he put just as much into that child as the woman did. if the mother chooses to have the child, why should she have to be the sole income source for the child when she’s only HALF the reason the child even exists???"
That would have been amazing. Would have made for even more dialog.
" @tanzeelaahmad2798  Because many women who have the time to protest are not only lazy, but selfish, thus why advocate for something that won't help me?"
" @bzuku9554  feminism doesn't help men, it actively hurts them. MRA helps men and women.
It's embarrassing that you got that backwards 😊❤️"
" @SeanWinters  

So ur saying right here that feminism doesn’t benefit men. If feminism fights for equality, why does it only benefit women and not men? Shouldn’t it benefit them both women and men equally?"
" @tanzeelaahmad2798   If feminism fought for equality, then yes it would benefit both. But that's an IF. Feminism does NOT fight for equality, it fights for female supremacy. It also fights for language restriction, financial restriction, and it promotes a guilt culture, a toxic culture which doesn't promote growth or love, but instead hate and distrust; after all, if you call someone ""x insult"" then doesn't that make you a good person?
This is not a minority of feminists either. This is the majority.

Also, equality of OPPORTUNITY is good. Equality of OUTCOME is radical and evil, another thing which many, many feminists believe in.

So no. Feminism is not about equality of opportunity between the sexes, it's about equality of OUTCOME between the sexes, which is in and if itself sexism and supremacy."
 @SeanWinters  I think we both agree with eachother but we somehow got into an argument
 @tanzeelaahmad2798  Ah I see.
" Angry Egalitarian  why do you think that women win custody battles more than men? It’s because of the stereotype that women are more “loving” and “motherly” and supposed to stay at home with the kids, cook, clean, and that men are supposed to work."
"Most MRA and feminists fights for equality and MRA just want men problems to get solved too, along with the women problems. 
There are many feminist too who are misandrists and just want men hating and ignores men problems and mra are just against them.
Tag does not matter. 
We should help both genders instead of fighting that who is better or who suffers more, we should for equality and HELP all genders. 
I am true feminist and true mra."
 @swaroop2518  yes
 @asg8813  ?????
 @swaroop2518  true
 @giri8034  ??
" @sarahfraser9532  yes men should pay half child support, but he should also get half custody of child after divorce."
YES
" @esmepersis351  mam man and women does not serve prison for same time for same mistake. 
Men serve 65% longer sentences than women for same mistake and women are twice as likely to not go to jail in compare to men. 
And also laws and women are biased towards women.
They assume that women are generally innocent. 
And people and society laughs at men being beaten by women. 
And law also does not take crimes against men seriously."
"A male can only support feminism and not be one, and it’s ok.
Feminism also talk about male rights and how it can be equal to female rights and there’s the difference between the 2 thins cause males rights people always set males rights before females."
"The women seemed to stand for
Men as well"
 @venusathenas.1628  racist
" Angry Egalitarian  the losing custody battle thing more has been debunked because in reality men do have chances in getting there children but they just don’t bother.  plus it’s fair because the person who gets the child is someone who can take care of them better, gender isn’t a deciding factor in custody battles."
" Angry Egalitarian  When women say they want equal rights they mean not having a dress code that just targets them, making women’s products the same price as mens, and more"
 Quagmire  that’s literally what feminism is

"Totally, totally. Men and women would be better is they could have at least a glimpse of each other. Wearing each other's shoes."
We could just photoshop someone else over Derrick tbh he isn’t very important in the conversation
 @esmepersis351  your first one is wrong. Men and women differently don't serve the same prison time
Popp
"Lmao for all these women saying that feminism isn't for women being superior its for equality name one male focused thing they've fought for.
You won't and can't because it doesn't exist, anything you hide behind a veil of helping men benefits women more.
But if you really want equality get rid of hiring based on minority status and do it based on who is qualified, the number of women in power will go down significantly. The reason why so many men are at the top is because they started at the bottom and worked themselves up, then women come along and complain about it being unfair theres all these men in power and they get power positions, not because of equality or because they're fit for the job but because there's too many men."
 @karmitdafruge1  Strawman argument.
I wish there was no need for feminism and men rights activism
" @wolfje6979  you don't know what that word means, you just have no response and want to dismiss it."
 @karmitdafruge1  i dont want children so maybe thats why i feel like it should be a decision for women whether they really want to be housewives or not :)
 @esmepersis351  ok and you will have to settle with men who already have kids then.
" @esmepersis351  that's a fair choice but most men around your age will want children eventually so once you have conflicting views your relationship will fall apart.
But since you dont want to be a house wife you want a house husband? He doesn't have to pay bills or pay for dates right? That's your job."
" @karmitdafruge1  nope, thanks. i'd much rather settle on my own or with a man or a woman without kids :)"
 @karmitdafruge1  what if we both work?
 @karmitdafruge1  what if we're not toxic and both of us pay? or we split?
" @esmepersis351  why do you get to choose being a housewife but a man can't choose not working? Most men want a woman at home because when both are working there's no time for you to be together.
So you want a man to be a traditional provider but you don't want to be a traditional house wife? None of your relationships will work period. You can't be a modern woman and traditional make your pick or stay alone."
" @esmepersis351  because calling everything toxic doesn't work in the real life, you can't be modern and traditional, men that are traditional earners will not want a modern woman who wants to work. You will have conflicting interests constantly."
 @karmitdafruge1  bruh im not gonna decide whether i work or not based on what they do. when i work (and i will no doubt) its up to them if they want to stay with me based on our time schedules.
" @esmepersis351  all of your arguments are based on what ifs and not real scenarios, im not sure if you're just a teenager or what but adults have shared responsibility, you split it, no man is gonna want to come home and have a messy house and no food made why does he even work then? Explain to me what the use is for you working too because for the life of me I can't imagine a scenario where you'd be better off working instead of being a housewife.
Your education and how much you make mean nothing to men."
 @SeanWinters  the moment you said beta male I was like 🙄🙄🙄
I'm a woman and would absolutely have done this for a mens activist
"Glad they didn't.  Not only would it be pandering, it would be false.  Both of those types are largely snakes in the grass."
We needs get Roma’s Army up in here
"Male feminists don’t exist unless they’ve done something extremely messed up to a woman. Before you get angry and go into keyboard warrior mode, check out Bill Burr’s comedy bit about it. Just Bc I’m not a male feminist doesn’t mean I don’t respect women. In fact, I think we should be equal, but that doesn’t make me a male feminist."
" Angry Egalitarian  if men want women to get drafted they should grant women equal pay, also take child leave, also give birth and so many other things. the chance of you getting drafted is small. the chance that a woman gets raped, abused, killed, assaulted etc is 97% of all women. women are unable to focus on their careers due to children that the husbands also want.

you're saying men and women are OK and equal with this sitution? would you like to live as a black transgender woman?"
 Angry Egalitarian  I explained where wage gap comes from. explain why I'm wrong and I'll take my words on that back.
 Angry Egalitarian  bro has never spoken to a woman in his life
Neither exist lmaoo
Same. Would be interesting.
 @SeanWinters  Yes
" @esmepersis351  The argument wasn't about ""why women don't get drafted"" but rather ""why women aren't fighting to be eligible for the draft"". I understand that men and women can't equally perform at some things due to biology. Childbirth,  sports, etc. But I think what these guys are saying is to fight to be equal EVEN when it's not beneficial to you, or equality can never be achieved.

Also, you partially addressed a reason for the pay gap. But before I continue, are you referring to the adjusted or unadjusted median pay gap? If you are referring to the unadjusted pay gap, women in the same fields and same experience and occupation make $0.98 to mens' $1.00. That doesn't meant that the woman is making less per hour if it's literally the same job and experience. The point you brought up is childbirth. If your job does have paid maternity leave, as many don't, you are going to see decreases in your pay. Unless your spouse will perform those duties. It's more than often going to be the woman who leaves to take care of the child. In my opinion, that has more to do with couples being transparent when it comes to childbirth and deciding who will be taking the hit to their career, unless both chip in and share in missing work. However the spouse who earns more will likely be the one to continue working and that is usually the man from my experience. Also a reason for the pay gap is that women don't receive promotions as much as men, but apparently there are studies indicating that they aren't as vocal when it comes to asking for said promotions. There is also definitely discrimination against women in various fields, which can also affect promotions. Despite this, multiple sources show that the gap has been steadily decreasing, which is awesome news!

Lastly you stated that because men generally make more, they should be the ones to pay child support if they aren't in their kid's life. I just want to pick your brain a bit. We just touched on the pay gap and its steady decline. When women and men are earning the same regardless of all the factors existing today, would you say a man who chooses not to be in his kid's life should still pay child support? This question kind of leads into my next. We all can agree that is is a woman's right to have autonomy over her body. As a result, women are the ones who decide whether or not a life is brought into this world. Men have no say, and rightfully so. Aside from rape victims and young immature teens whose minds have not fully developed, adult women who have consensual, unprotected sex and get pregnant essentially do not have to be held accountable for their decision because they can simply decide to abort it. As I said, I am for the woman's right to choose. However, as the man has no say in that matter, he is almost always going to be held accountable in the form of child support, if he decides he does not want to be an involved father. I've seen arguments about the equality of this matter. With that said, from a legal standpoint, do you feel that men and women have equality when it comes to being held accountable for their consensual, sexual encounters? It's like I said. I know men and women can never be equal when it comes to childbirth, but are we as equal as we can be is what I'm trying to get at. Apologies for the long, dragged-out post lol."
" @sarahfraser9532  Hi Sarah. We can both agree that is a woman's right to have autonomy over her body. As a result, women are the ones who decide whether or not a life is brought into this world.

 @dynculalic3696  I’m a male feminist?
Pick me girl
 @SeanWinters  yikes lol
@Sandrine Simons if that happened to a male child that wouldnt be as big as a deal
 @bzuku9554  Not all Feminists but most of them.
 @segseefrog4748  The trouble is the loud minority always wins so that's all you hear about not about all the nice Men who see Women as equals.
" Angry Egalitarian  Wow...you get off from this, don't you? ew 

I'm amazed I could recognize an incel in the wild just wasting everyone's time"
"I'm spotting so many incels today, it's like going to zoo again."
No woman in their right mind would misunderstand a situation so badly that they'd believe in mens rights advocacy
 @SeanWinters So your take is that you're only a real man if you want to make women into your property.
" @SeanWinters  ""Maybe you don't know what feminism is."" I think it's you that doesn't know what feminism is. Feminism is simply the idea that women should have equal rights and protections under the law, and that both women and men should not be pressured into conforming to specific gender stereotypes. We've accomplished part 1 of that to a large extent (though there are still some gaps) but we have a long way to go on #2 and that's why feminism still exists.

By the way on your comment that equality of outcome is evil, that is not always correct. A better way of putting it I think is, equal outputs for equal inputs. Some could construe this as equality of outcome but it actually makes sense. For instance, in the justice system we expect that no matter who the defendant is, they will be judged based on the crime they committed. That is technically equality of outcome. I think what people are simply advocating for is the idea that if we both do the same work, we should get comparable outcomes, but that isn't happening right now. Women are getting compensated less for the same work. Now it's not the oft cited 75 cents to teh dollar or whatever, its closer to 95 cents on the dollar, but that gap adds up the higher paying the jobs get. And you can say that pay gap doesnt exist, but the fact that it's been closing from where it was 40 or 50 years ago shows you are just wrong."
" @trollnerd  if that's the case, then why have I never actually met one of these so called equal rights feminists in real life? Every single feminist I've ever spoken to does not actually believe in equal rights, they want female privilege. That's all they ever want. You're arguing something called a no true Scotsman fallacy, and your denying my truth."
" @SeanWinters  See that view of yours stems from a very basic misunderstanding of feminism, and really civil rights in general. White nationalists often fall into this same trap. It's the idea that equality is a zero sum game. That when you elevate previously marginalized groups that you are also robbing the previously privileged groups of an inherently deserved advantage. It's a false reality which stems from either experiencing that privilege yourself or learning that in the past your existence would have been privileged and then being forced to accept a world in which it no longer is."
" @trollnerd  Wait, you just described equality as a zero sum game. You don't make people equal by pulling others down. You have to bring them up. Too bad feminists disagree. That's why feminists so often are sexist. You don't even realize the privilege that you already have above men, it's ridiculous.
Just like a white supremacist, you pretend you're not sexist- but you can't hide that. Everyone already knows you are.
You believe in equality of outcome. That is completely exclusionary to the wants and wishes of people. You can't force people into jobs they don't want to take, but that's what equality of outcome requires. Studies in Sweden show clear as day that the more equal a country, the wider the difference between the genders, specifically when it comes to jobs. Therefore you literally can't have equality of outcome unless you're a tyrant and remove people's choice. EoO therefore is an evil ideal.
I, like any reasonable person agree with equality of opportunity, which we already have to the best of our ability. Considering that, and the fact that women already have more rights than men, you wanting even more ""rights"" makes you a supremacist, not an egalitarian. You, however, won't be happy until equality of outcome is achieved, and that's tyrannical."
"​ @SeanWinters  I didn't describe equality as a zero sum game. The idea that it's a zero sum game IS the fallacy. It's not. Freedom is the default, and freedoms can only be taken away, not given. Like if you steal from me and I take it back, did you lose something? No, you took something from me first, all I did was take it back, and now we're even again. 

As for equality of outcome as I said it's about equal outputs for equal inputs. If you want to call that equality of outcome, then by all means, but that concept is not evil or wrong. It's how the world ought to be. Obviously we can't accomplish that in all circumstances, but we hope to, adn we should do our best to strive for it. 

To explain this further, lets compare it to a race. Equality of opportunity is the idea that we all get the same starting point. Equality of outcome is the idea that if we can both run at the same top speed, we should both finish the race at the same time. However there's a lot that can happen between point A and point B. For instance, if someone decided to put hurdles in my lane, and no hurdles in your lane, then even though we had equality of opportunity, when I come against those hurdles, I'm going to have to slow down, then speed up again, even though going at full speed we run the at the same pace. So what we need to do is remove those hurdles in the path so that it's not just an equitable STARTING POINT but also an equitable JOURNEY."
" @trollnerd  Everyone has different hurdles. Those literally can't be equalized. The thing you seem to not realize is that not everyone runs the same race. Some people run 40 yard dashes, some people run 4ks. Some people don't run at all. Not everyone has equal inputs, so the idea that we ought to see equal outputs is wrong.

For instance, I'll take a wild guess and assume you believe the gender pay gap? It's not a pay gap. It's an earnings gap. More women don't work than men. More women take lower paying jobs. Men and women don't get paid different for the same job, they get paid different based on the choices they make. That has nothing to do with civil rights, that IS the civil right, that you can choose lower paying jobs or have no job if you want to.

Also, your stealing analogy implies that women's rights were ""stolen"" from them. They weren't. Women wrote history just as much as men did. Do you not realize the power that women have always had in western society?"
" @SeanWinters  Sorry maybe i'm not being clear. What i mean is equal outputs for the SAME inputs. Obviously not everyone has identical inputs but often there are inputs which are close enough that we should see relatively equal outputs. Once again this is not what we expect to achieve, but what ought to be our goal. And in attempting to achieve that goal, we will reach a greater degree of equality from this perspective. I don't think that's evil or wrong, and I don't think you do either.

Women's rights ABSOLUTELY were stolen by men. For nearly all of human history, women were literally property. They were sold and traded like slaves. In marriage they had no rights at all, and were basically wards of their husbands. The very fact that women couldn't vote invalidates everything you said there. 

And the gender pay gap, yeah thats a tricky subject. The oft cited 75 cents per dollar or whatever is obviously wrong, but there is a gap of about 95 cents per dollar. This is a well documented fact. I don't really want to discuss the gender pay gap because it's widely misunderstood by both sides, and really isn't THAT big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. All I'll say about it is that it HAS shrunk in the past few decades which does indicate that at the very least it used to exist, but it is mostly a solved issue. There still exist some inequities here but there are much bigger fish to fry."
They do have male feminists but most likely not the other way around unfortunately
Think they should do a part 2 cause this is such an important topic
"Not gonna lie, I'm more interested in supporting men's rights than supporting toxic women's rights."
"​ @peagames2002  LMAO ""mens rights"" is the biggest joke ever. I'm sorry what rights are men currently being denied?"
" @trollnerd  The right of being heard when a woman is physically/mentally assaulting them. It is considered specifically irrelevant to support women's 'right' to do crimes as they please because it is considered ""empowerment""... I call that pure opportunism, counterproductive and hateful. And the right of 'free healthcare' for men aka. father test to tell if partner's child is from his seed or someone else, and fair justifications from either results."
" @peagames2002 What are you even talking about with that first one. You have the right to say whatever you want to a woman, and if she physically assaults you, call the police. What are you even talking about with supporting their right to ""do crimes"". This is completely incoherent babble. Paternity tests are available to anyone who wants one, and you can have one prenatally. If you think the child isn't yours, don't sign the birth certificate until after you've had a paternity test, its that simple. What on earth are you even talking about."
Everyone does
I agree. There are many very eloquent and informed female men’s rights activists.
 @uoutoii6211  women are already more than equal
I bet changing sex would make a huge difference
As long as they replace Darrik i dont care
Women who stand up for men’s rights are called Honeybadgers
 @esmepersis351  which country do you live in ?
This should be fun...
That would be cool
Roma Army shouldve been there :/
" @esmepersis351  your first point is wrong and so is your second point. Men serve way more prison times and get in prison more often due to the court being biased, and for the second im 80% sure that ppl advocated against women getting drafted."
 @esmepersis351  also so is your 3rd point. Sexual assault ≠ rape. Men also dont get their children in family court even if they’re s/o is abusive to their kids. Furthermore the pay gap has been disproven time and time again.
" @esmepersis351  3rd wave feminism is for superiority, you proved that with the other reply"
 @valehuber2232  if you’re talking about other countries other than 1st world countries I couldn’t talk about that considering I haven’t read any article stating it is/isnt
 @wot4192  you said thats not considered feminism bc they are toxic and yet you call everyone incels. Ironic is it not
" @MuslimanDardania  Plan b is something all countries have, but it only works the day after you've had sex, and if you don't have it at home or you can't get it, you'll have to go in for an abortion."
" @esmepersis351  women aren’t stronger than men physically, deal with it. When serving your country, people’s feelings is the last thing you care about. They want the strongest soldiers possible and unfortunately, women got the short end of the biological straw."
" Onion Potato  yeah that's a lie. One in 10 at the most, unless you're talking about a tiny tiny group. Most men's rights groups I'm familiar with are more like 95%+ male. There are very, very few female mra's"
If Feminism wants an equality. Then why when men raped a women the man has to die by Death Penalty. But when women raped men. The woman didn't get to the jail. Because no one will believe you. If you want equality then the woman should die on death penalty too. Salary?? No. When women gets more money than man. Most woman (not all) will leave that man. I remember when someone I know that his wife is a secretary of a company and my friends job is he sells bed. Walking while carrying that bed to the houses. he do that because of his children. But in the end his wife leaves him saying I make more money than you. And she cheated on his husband for a richer guy. Richer than his salary as a secretary. That's hurts so bad. If women wants an equality. Then they should carry heavy items like us. If women wants an equality then they should go to military just like us and etc. When it comes to Women Rights. They have more rights than men. Here in my country. If the man cheated on his wife. The husband will go to jail but the Mistress won't go to jail. If the law are Equal. Then the Mistress should go to jail too. Women don't need equality. Women need Protection and Special Treatment. Geez.
SAME
 @uoutoii6211  If u understood the actual real origins of that word before the internet that's pretty much exactly what it means
YESS
There are plenty for example papa gut is a male feminists and roma army is a males rights advercet
"I am a in school to become a social services worker and my goal is to be some type of advocate for men. I understand and agree with a lot of everyones points throughout the video (beside Derick because he obviously ignorant to others opinions). but a lot of people are surprised by me wanting to advocate for mens rights especially since I am a girl, but moving forward I don't want to advocate for mens rights in order to push women's rights to the side. that's one thing I didn't fully agree with is when Mimi said that when she thinks of mens rights advocates its out of anger towards feminists and push that to the side; I want to advocate for mens rights because I've seen many injustices men go through (my dad in particular) which I won't get into because that is a long story. I want to advocate for men so the emotions, trauma, abuse, mental illness and whatever else they go through gets heard and taken serious, and when they do so I want them to feel like they're safe to do so"
 @valehuber2232  FEMINISM IS MISANDRY.
 @esmepersis351  ok misandrist.
 @karo_edt.8402  I can think of several ways feminism harmed men.
 @rose-oo7hc  I can think of several ways feminism harmed men without any reason.
 @bzuku9554 I can think of several ways feminism harmed men.
 @SeanWinters  maybe you dont know what feminism is?
" @marissacarbone7625  Are you looking for something sexist in something that benefits only you?,"
Same
I don't think there's such thing as a female 'MRA' (Men's Rights Activist)
Agreed
" @esmepersis351   
 Not a single one of your statements is true."
" @esmepersis351  uhm what? hating men doesn’t make you a lesbian, like wtf?"
same
Wtf does that mean
Doesn't make any important difference
Maybe if they did. The feminist side probably wouldn’t of gotten so emotional
Exactly! And get rid of the incel! He was no help!
@SF.shadow Cat what does that have to do with anything?
I wonder what they think about nonbinary people lol. like imagine I walk in the room and they just sparaticly evaporate lmao
Y'all just want drama 🤣
They do
"As a female MRA, me too!"
yeah
"The ""men's rights"" dudes would probably listen to the male feminist, since they love men so much"
Wtf you donout
What did this “Baret” individual say?
You can’t even spell female without male
 @coolkidgamerap1233  So?
They do
I believe every gender should be equal
 @rose-oo7hc  lol you're kind but pretty naive
 @uoutoii6211  you can't even spell women without men
I treat everyone equally i wont treat women better than the boys honestly
Lmao there's no point literally ofc ppl would be in the feminist guy side
♂️♀️
 @maddieeee1209  women do have privileges
Because women are attracted to men with more testosterone which is why the Asian guy is getting his point across more without interruptions. Women and men treat the more attractive people better. Derrick makes many valid points but the women don’t like him being the one to bring them up. Lol
"kjobful why are you comparing a debate to... attraction? like it literally doesn’t have anything to do. Btw a lot, and when i say a lot i mean a LOT of women are attracted to women so like, your point?"
"kjobful pretty sure Bea was pretty open to what Derrick was saying... the only reason you can tell they don’t like what he’s saying is not because of his looks, but because he literally stated that he doesn’t believe men and women should be equal... how is that a valid point?? he really thinks men are superior to women, claiming that kids aren’t equals to adults.. probably the worst analogy to use. also, the two other men i would say had valid points when it came across divorce trials and custody over children because i could understand an argument like that, but derrick is on a whole other level that’s just completely one sided."
salty sloth women historically have been treated like kids and babied by society since the beginning of time which is what has led to women having this extreme sense entitlement in western cultures. So him comparing them to children is more spot on than women would like to admit. My only knock on his statement is he didn’t provide and evidence to back his statement. And there is OVERWHELMING evidence to back that statement/comparison. And to be clear I don’t support feminism or mgtow both are capitalist funded movements to keep men and women fighting. But the non emotional dialogue is extremely healthy.
"kjobful okay... but maybe women don’t want to be “babied”? women also don’t want to be compared to children, simple as that. yeah, maybe we have been because we weren’t aloud the same privileges as white males, but still. derrick wants to go back to where males were highly superior to women, that’s why they don’t like what he’s saying."
"also, maybe they don’t like what’s coming out of Derrick’s mouth because he has way more extreme ideals than the other two men?? just a thought?"
 @kjobful  maybe because of the way he stated his arguments compared to the other man who kept it to a certain extent trying to prevent offending the other party? Uhm no? Take a breath ✨s i s✨👁👄👁
"C.I.A yeah, it is 💖"
Mochi’sEuophoria Lyf could be a possibility but I work in the music business and have seen artist work with ghostwriters A ton and I seen first hand how 2 people can say the same thing but one of those people could get more praise for it. what Derrick was saying wasn’t disrespectful in general but he got nervous finishing his point and providing no context.
" @kjobful   Wow, no, they are listening to him because he is the only one who states his arguments calmly. He has different opinions but he remains calm and actually listens. The other two... Derrick is just an incel and the other guy is too aggressive when he is speaking. His politeness and not his attractiveness is what make other people listen to him"
"kjobful i mean that’s just wrong, like attraction has no part in debates"
Ulalume calmly are you sill the guy asked the female to name 1 organization to support her argument and she responded emotionally because she had no answer to support her statement why is it ok get her to do it and not everyone else
" @kjobful  she did not respond emotionally, she replied she didn't have a list in hand so she couldn't answer. If someone was emotional there, was the guy asking for the companies, he was quite passionate about it."
Ulalume 😂😂😂 she responded very emotionally trying to undermine the fact that he asked her a question about something someone who claims they’re a feminist should know and she came TOO A DEBATE with no research done what so ever then got mad about it lol
" @kjobful  firstly he interrupted her raising his voice over hers, secondly he was speaking quickly and loud as if he was upset and finally he shot a question different to what she was speaking about. She wasn't sure of that particular one because she is not a robot and doesn't hold infinite knowledge. She just said she was not sure. Actually she is the one stating facts from the beginning. So the only one diminishing her is you."
 @kjobful  they don't like his points because he was referencing the 1950s as a golden era not to mention 2 of them where poc and would be even more greatly discriminated against at that time.
The two from the left looked done the moment they sat down.
kjobful valid? So sexism and regressive gender roles are valid points to you??
 @kjobful  wtf
 Nigel Knox  I am a minor so I guess that explains it.
 @kjobful  wanna debate me?
" @saltysloth6814  he did not state men and women shouldn't be equal. He said they're NOT equal, which is true. Man and women are not equal no matter what you say"
"MineatomTR he implied it. by saying men aren’t equal to women, do you mean as in men are just always gonna be superior to women, and that’s it?"
" @saltysloth6814  no side is superior, they just have their differences so that makes them equivalent rather than equal. (which is the statement I prefer to be honest, men and women is not equal statement is kinda you know, could be understood wrong)
By the way I'm not defending Derrick in any way its just about this statement"
Itzmekaylee lol I’m shocked people are still commenting on this post lol. But sure about what?
helth says who you have no facts on that only they would know
yumi duh both genders do it people are judged by their looks. ITS CALLED THE HALO EFFECT
" @kumozumo  welcome to the real world. Attraction has everything to do with people. That's a fact, no matter how much you argue a point, attractive people statistically always get treated better. Just look at your social media and real life interaction."
 @kjobful  just say you’re sexist and go oh my god
 @kjobful  why tf are you bringing physical attraction into this that’s not part of what the comment is saying and doesn’t connect with the comment i
They reflected my face every step of the way. 😂
Nardos Abenet of course!
" @kjobful  No, it's because while the women and other two men are trying to have a productive argument, Derrick's arguments are rooted in feeling and that comes out in his articulation."
" @kjobful  if the Asian guy was saying the things that Derrick was saying I then wouldn’t like the Asian guy.. just the simple fact when the girls would sit down for “is toxic masculinity real?” Or the other things that they would sit down for, Derrick and the tall articulate guy, but mainly Derrick would be over there snickering and smiling at their views, the other side never did that when the men would sit down. Without even having to watch any part of the video that alone pissed me off at the lack of respect. The Asian guy out of all of them did his best to be respectful, and truly understand the situation"
 @kumozumo  seems a feminist rant..what does some women being attracted to women have to do with anything?
" @AkshayKumar-ue1fp  because he started his argument with “women are attracted to men” and that’s far from the truth, your gender doesn’t determine your sexual orientation"
 @kjobful  it’s his fault then for not adhering to his own ideology.
 @kjobful  HAH you're all the way wrong dude
 @kjobful  no
 @kjobful  Which valid points are those? pls tell me you scientist
It's his voice and his attitude to getting his point. I know he can't change that but it drives me crazy.
Bro I would be too like
 @kjobful  lmao sounds like you're projecting here
I hate everything that moves at this point including me.
 @saltysloth6814  they aren't
 @kjobful  THATS TUE I TOTALLY AGREE
" @angela65789  bruh you just prooved his point by saying ""Derrick is just an incel"" lmao."
" @kumozumo  what you are saying proves their point, women are attracted to other women makes them more agreeing in a debate so you don't see women debate as much as men"
so glad i'm not the only one that thought that
I immediately thought of that when I saw them
Replace Derek
Are there really any women who are men's rights activists?
 @derpdawg3492  yes
why would a woman be a mens rights activist tho
 @derpdawg3492  And Alyesha
Dark Black Because feminism protects men too..
 @lamorosioriginals8216  HAHAHAHHAHA
 @dinochickenuggy  right here
JUMPINGALMO why tho?
I`m female and I`m for men`s rights :s
" @dinochickenuggy  example...Roma
edit: I mean Roma Army"
mnk ok but are you a men’s rights activist or are you for equality because they’re different
 @dinochickenuggy  I'm not an activist in any form...I just sit back and observe and once or twice in a while throw in my opinion to a certain statement
mnk same
Dark Black why wouldn’t they be 😂 are you a derek here?
Random weeb but that’s not being a men’s right activist in the way the video portrays it. I’m saying are there really women who are not feminists (I know feminists touch on men’s rights btw) and JUST men’s rights activists.
"Mia who knows, there’s no point speculating, but i’ve come to the conclusion that if you’re not both (a feminist and a men’s right activist) you either don’t speak up, or are yet to realise that both genders are discriminated against."
 @dinochickenuggy  because mens' issues are being ignored.
Sameee
 @bek0536  because feminist means gender equality and not that women are superior?
" @DP-mv7ph  ""equality"""
Feminism its not for us man.....its a place for women by women.
 @lloydevans1039  I agree as I'm both
100%
" Local Clown  I don/t necessarily support feminism, as you know Im more of a men`s rights advocate. I do believe, however, that both men and women SHOULD be treated equally with respect and appreciate each other 

Men are told as kids that they cannot cry, but im highly against that because no matter what they say, it is OK for men to cry, it/s what makes us people. Another point being unfair legislations such as men cannot be classified as victims of rape by women. Quoting the video, just because men are biologically stronger doesnt mean they cannot be attacked or be victims in the hands of females in any given situation. By definition, rape is unwanted or pressured sex. anyone can be raped and anyone can be capable of raping 

I/ve also noticed a lot of unfair treatment of men by a lot of feminists who are actively against men/s rights as human beings, which is unironically sexism. Ignoring current events by using the past as an excuse will not make our problems go away"
" @neveronhereXD  What feminists have you seen because if they do say that men dont deserve human rights, they’re not feminists. Also most feminists aren’t just for women’s rights they advocate for men too."
" @dinochickenuggy  I am aware most feminist don`t behave as mentioned above. Furthermore, women have more social advantages than men in certain areas. I pointed out society`s sexism and double standards against the men -"
 @neveronhereXD  But either way can we all just agree that there are struggles for both men and women and if anyone disputes that they’re wrong?
Exactly and they shouldn't have brought an incel into this
 @DP-mv7ph   why wouldn't we
Right
Ikr
 @bek0536  because feminism is so much different then mens rights
: )
 @dinochickenuggy  true tho.. Didn't think of that
 @dinochickenuggy  i wanted to ask the same question
 @lamorosioriginals8216  no it doesn't
"It would have been a more productive conversation, but I think that, although they do exist, finding a female men's rights activist would be hard"
i agree
 @dinochickenuggy  Not any...sooo many. They make 10% of the MRA. They r a group called Honey Badgers who work inside the MRA movement.
Yes
" @derpdawg3492  oml true, he was super annoying."
 @derpdawg3492  yes there are many as well as there's women who think that saying I'm not a feminist makes them superior! and that the fact that they say that invalidates the while feminist movement!  hahahahaha
May i vote ROMA ARMY she is a men's rights activist
"Yes, they should have!"
 @dinochickenuggy  I’m a woman and I’m not a feminist. I wouldn’t consider my self a men’s rights activist but I would debate them anyway
Yeah because in this instance it insinuates that feminism is only for women and it only cares about the interest of women and it insinuates that feminism doesn’t include men
like im a cis guy femanist
" @dinochickenuggy  There are definitely a ton, if anyone had an experience like I did growing up I thought that feminists were misandryists trying to act like they were woke in order to cover up there true beliefs (which is only true for an insanely small pat of ""feminists"" (i put it in quotes because they're only pretending to be feminists.)),
Though I still believe in men's rights, I'm just not apart of the ""Men's rights movement"" anymore which is a branch of the men's movement, which is basically anti-feminist, and feminism is the reason for all our problem, I'm more apart of the ""Men's liberation movement"""
" @neveronhereXD  I'd probably be careful with the wording on that because the ""Men's rights movement"" is the anti-feminist branch of the ""Men's movement"" which basically believe feminism is the root of all their problems, which some indirectly were caused by media dramatizing feminism."
 @dinochickenuggy  I'm a member of the MRA
How many times am I going to hear this
 @lamorosioriginals8216  PFTTTTT nice one
 @dinochickenuggy  chloe Sunderland...
I'm a woman for mens rights. And I can answer any questions on WHY exactly i chose this path.
@Anyssa De Gracia That's the way it should be but in today's society it doesn't work that way. I'm from the equality state and women and men are treated with the same exact respect. But from afar I see the way California treats men. The way other states treat men as well.
Gotten a Simp and a pickme girl
 @bek0536  because isn’t exclusively beneficial to women and you’d be surprised how many men have recognized this and are active participants.
 @dinochickenuggy  me
 @va902  why
 @dinochickenuggy  and why you don't?
 @va902  you didn’t even answer my question
 @dinochickenuggy  -but... i did?
that would be really interesting
 @va902  sorry it’s not showing up for me
Agreed. Having varied gender on both sides probably would have offered some different insights on each side.
 @dinochickenuggy  yes there are.
 @bek0536  Feminism is equality?
thats what I said!!
"This is old, but yes"
 @DP-mv7ph  why wouldn't?
" @DP-mv7ph  no.
It doesn't, the movement don't even try to help men in any way shape or form.(they just try to dehumanize them.)"
" @dinochickenuggy  Hi, sry to reply to a comment from a year ago, but yeah there are. And there is a channel you can check out if you want, its called Roma Army Men's Rights."
That was my first thought oo
" @bek0536  Nah, Alyesha's cool"
No he’s not representative. People dont live in the past.
I'm a guy and although Derrick was an A-hole he doesn't represent all men don't paint a brush over guys please
"I'm Groot  um, what makes you say that? 😅"
Edward Teach A.K.A Blackbeard  oh ok 😂
" Edward Teach A.K.A Blackbeard  no?



He's groot."
I was stopping myself from punching the damn screen
@I'm Groot Since when?
 cartohead  How come? They just asked a question?
"@I'm Groot Sure, kitten, believe what you want XD"
@I'm Groot I'm not a feminist XD
"@I'm Groot Yeah, I believe more on gender equality"
I really wanted to buy a plane ticket travel to America and slap some sense into him
 @keylahjooste6543  you do realise feminism literally revolves around gender equality. You literally can't be a feminist if you don't believe I'm gender equality.
" @laylai.5242  I do, hun, I'm very aware of these things, trust me. But you kbow, I'm tired fighting with idiots like the person i was talking to, was trying to find some middle ground, so as a person that accepts many things amd is very open minded, I'll kindly ask that you don't ask me of all things questions like this"
 @keylahjooste6543  ok but both of you talked about feminism and gender equality as if they're opposites
" @laylai.5242  I never said that they're opposites, love, we were talking about what they assumed were all feminists, but i was trying to talk about feminazis, the feminists that want to hurt all men and nonsense like that"
Lightskin Superman was that supposed to hurt my feelings? yikes it could use some work
I second that
I 3rd that.
I fourth that
And I will fifth that
Sixth it please
I seventh it 🙋🏽‍♀️
Or even more uncommon - a female men's right activist
Male feminist vs female MRA
that would be interesting as fuck
i eighth that
LOOKS LIKE THEY PICKED ALL WOMEN TO ON THE FEMINIST SIDE
plsss
I ninth that
I would gladly be that male feminist.
I tenth that.
mushy peas that sounds dope
mushy peas I eleventh that
Or a male feminist vs a female men’s rights activist
I Eleventh that
My Chorus teacher is a male feminist
his soy level would be too high to not be contagious
Yeah I thought it would have been alot more open and boarder opinions with mixed genders. Also so they could challenge their own gender
Yeeeeesss
YESSS
i fifteenth that
I mean it’s true it’s hard for us but Derrick will never find one if he’s that sexist
 @huaraches8934  true
Its hard to find a girl even if you are not Derrick
 @dodgemaster6963  fr
400th like
Bruh with men we have to come up with the best pick up line possible to hopefully get with a girl with a girl all the have to do is say yes so that’s kinda true
 @heatcheque5213  but for derrick especially it’s impossible lol
"No, she had a point. The MRAs kept talking about how men are biologically lesser parents while the feminists said people were equals. 
The entire conversation was the guys answer"
" @nickyturnbull2172  ""Men and women are not equal""
This mentality is why feminism exists and why she was correct. Again, the entire conversation was the MRA being proven wrong.
Also weird the MRA's complained about losing custody cases when they specifically said men are biologically worse at being parents."
"​ @regisglass5464 , how are men and women equal?

He proved her wrong. Face it. She couldn't name any organisations as there aren't any."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  per you also stating men and women aren't equal, thank you for again demonstrating the feminist had a point.
Or do you believe in the MRA misandry that is seeing men as biologically lesser parents?"
 @regisglass5464  how exactly are m en and w omen equal?
" @DavidW-ux2gc  thus i reiterate the query you avoid. Do you disagree with the MRA's misandry that men are lesser parents? Do you then agree with the feminists that the sexes are equals?
And again, thank you for showing why feminism exists."
"​ @regisglass5464  but the sexes aren't equals. So no, the feminists are incorrect."
​ @regisglass5464  please kindly explain how we're equal.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  hence the query you avoid: are men biologically lesser parents compared to women or are they equals as the feminists noted?
"​ @regisglass5464 , how are we equal? We're different."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  thus the query you avoid: are men biologically lesser parents or are the sexes equals (as per the feminists)?
"​ @regisglass5464  they're different parents. Men can't give birth, for instance. 

Why are care jobs dominated by women?"
 @DavidW-ng5zv  and how are they different that men lose nearly all custody cases? Do you believe men are simply worse parents?
"​ @regisglass5464  because women want a dad who is strong and earns money.

Why do you care about parents?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  then as you state all a father is is someone who gives money, does this mean you do believe men are inherently worse parents?
Or how are women different that they win nearly all custody cases?"
 @doncheadle8876  that's why i'm repeating the question. you probably noted he keeps trying to downplay or avoid saying he thinks men are lesser parents.
​ @doncheadle8876  you believe in equity...
​ @doncheadle8876  because it's a ridiculous concept.
Mimi too
yes
MCN - mimi spoke facts the whole time wdym honey
Hypocrite
 @koifishboy12  NOT A CHANCE LOL. She couldn't site a single source. It was all emotion...
" @koifishboy12  Lol not a damn single one of those had any fact behind it, Mimi is crazy!"
Austin Chamberlain - just cuz she doesn’t have facts doesn’t mean she can’t have experiences...
Sadly there is something called the right to free speech and this guy has every right to his opinion no matter how much it hurts
Master_ E true
Master_ E honestly I just laughed at he comments though i don’t actually care what he say I don’t give a crap about anything to do with that or protest
 Master_ E  Several men here hate Derrick too
were u the one that kicked his ass in school and took his lunch money lol just clowning but i cant help it  something wrong with him
"im laughing at the fact that all of the most replayed parts are skipping over derricks ""contributions"""
Derrick is such a legend. Repeal the 19th.
The incel isn’t an MRA
I think they should have also discussed toxic feminnity
You can tell everyone was weirded out and uncomfortable around Derrick
"He really said “Finding a girl at all is difficult”  
I wonder why it be like that for him ..."
"“My mom, she’s a female” ZIP IT HOT DOG WATER KIDDO"
"Bish when Derrick said ""I'm a youtuber and an incel"" her face fell faster than me falling asleep"
I love how the women are more hateful then the men here. The men wanted insight and the women just wanted to belittle.
"Women always make it about me, me, me instead of, let me take it out of myself and let me think of other women"
I wonder what the comment section would look like without derrick
"I think this was the first middle argument I've watched, where everyone did not hug at the end"
i think derrick was picked off the street for comedy relief. It worked he was my fav lol.
The derrick hate is actually justifiable
Before Derrick even said anything I’m looking at this man like “Yep he’s gonna be that guy”
"I’m sorry I can’t have a serious convo with someone who’s wearing a spider man jacket, probably plays video games all day, and probably never showers...."
"14:32 she proceeds to say when a movement is created another group feels attacked. Then immediately proved that by attacking men for creating a movement to address their problem, yet claiming men are attacking feminism by advocating for their rights. They never are introspective and contradict themselves why perpetuating the discrimination they claim to experience."
"16:12 her reaction when he checkmate her 😂 ""i don't come with a list my dude"" then don't come at all and let someone who actually knows what they're doing replace her and talk 💀"
I love how Derrick was like “I can’t have a female friend” like what?!?! You can’t that’s just ridiculous
I would have LOVED to see a feminist man and a men's rights woman.
Then why do they all agree with him?
​ @regisglass5464  wores also makeup 30% of feminists doesn't mean we judge their ideals
" @miscerswetdream  feminists saying no to incels is about standards, not about ideals. Kind of weird you think saying not to sex makes them ""wores"" though.
Either way, thank you for agreeing incels correlate with MRAs."
 @regisglass5464   ok incel 👍
​ @regisglass5464  you don't even know what an in cel is
 @DavidW-ng5zv  then would you like to define what in-cel stands for?
​ @regisglass5464  I have never seen any convincing arguments from feminists.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  then why not define what incel stands for?
"​ @regisglass5464  I told you. It's involuntary celibate, aka a m an who can't get laid.

However, you've acknowledged that feminism has no convincing arguments"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  excellent, thank you for defining in-cel and showing this correlates with MRAs. Are there any points the MRAs give that don't have to do with being incels?"
"​ @regisglass5464  they bring up male s uicide rates and violence against men.

Why are you against issues men face being brought up?"
Might be worth empathising with what it's like to be him and know that what you're saying is true.
I was watching him
yo why u bully him like that lol
lmaoo
Arrrmmmmyyy💜💜💜💜
Yassssssss
HAHAAHHAHAH FR
"Carmen Bermejo I think he said “My mom, you know, I love her”"
Carmen Bermejo not funny didn't laugh
😂😂
" @seivorsichtig  After that, he said "" she's a female""."
Carmen Bermejo im so dead 😭
Lmao why does hot dog water kid sum him up so well
Yeah I saw it too
I said “Oh Lord” right when I heard YouTuber
Are you tuber what is not the bad part of being one of those you tubers they give people a bad reputation of some you tubers are majority of YouTube or’s that are underrated is this guy
"I'm saying bro Zach asked for her reasoning and to explain it, and she went off on him. Even putting words in his mouth."
Most likely alot of arguing but derrick seems to have been that unifying force
DUUUUUUUUDE It would be good
Lol same
"Love how nobody is calling out the woman on their awful takes and logicies, instead focus on the ONE awful men's rights activist."
Less funny
probably a lot of fighting
"in a way, derrick saved this comment section from being a warzone"
" @OneAndOn1y  he unified it because despite having different ideological beliefs, we can all agree that derrick is a pos, he pretty much bridged the gap between people who disagree with each other's ideologies in this comment section"
Derrick*
@arrogant cat Want to explain any further as to how there is any correlation between me and that guy?
blank
" @arizz620  no, he doesn’t. He just wants that statement to bother you because it would bother him."
Pro la LG about Zack
I don't want to imagine hugging derrick
The men were worried about going in for a hug because the women were feminist
At least they shook hands...
"They didn't feel like the other side understood them. Both sides felt like they just got further away from each other than where they started, probably. That was so sad."
The men. Are scared of accusations
" @yagadoobigidibobbibigabiga38  it really was, I was hoping for some kind of conversation. But then again this is the reality of the situation on both sides, who have both yet to hear some kind of understanding. At least the women were actually trying to agree to the other side, and some did agree. 

Honestly if they had replaced Derrick it would've looked better, as he was the most extreme, but also not that knowledgeable about what he was actually talking about."
 @adamcarter271  how is it not respecting their personal space? The men didn't invade the women's space so they are comfortable
" @jasminecastillo1441  yeah. I felt like the women were trying to connect on a social/emotional level with the men and make them understand, and the men were trying to have a conversation about the facts. That isn't a bad thing at all, but that was why they just ended up even further away from understanding than they were at the start. I would've loved to be there to bridge the two sides more (I'm the type of person who tries to consider all sides instead of going in with a singular mindset.)"
"For Derrick's sake, his first time needs to be more special than that"
Dude yep! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
" @risen1300  i get your point of earning ""respect"" but the thing is. you don't wanna make a woman who you just had a discussion with, who spoke about being physically violated by entitled men all her life think that you are trying to do something in any manner to mirror that even in the slightest manner specifically when they are certified feminists who atleast in their head might take it the wrong way? Because then noone is gonna stick around to listen their side of the story. 



I did notice that woman who scoffed at the idea of men's rights. I was appalled by it but I do see where she is coming from. So yea."
professional labelmaker 😨🤢never😰🤮
"@Hope(less) Some of the things they say are true (regarding inequality in the judicial system or custody) but there are also things that they tried to push as facts even though they were pretty subjective, I'd personally say I'm more in line with the feminist's way of thinking while taking some of men's issues into mind (mostly the issues regarding custody, penalties in the judicial system and mental health issues)."
" @risen1300  At 14:40, Bea acknowledges from Zach bias in court cases. At 19:45 Bea recognizes abuse on men, particularly from other women who associate themselves with the feminist movement. At 21:00, Aleysha asks the men for their stories. They're willing to listen."
"@Hope(less) ...so we're not gonna talk about the obvious bias in the criminal justice department against men? That's a fact. And allow me to correct myself: they attempted, and sometimes did succeed, on talking factually. They came in with the goal to talk factually, but they probably didn't anticipate that there wasn't any way in hell that they would get to talk entirely about facts."
The guy Kursat secretly recorded the whole thing and posted the audio on his YouTube channel. If you search his full name it’ll come up
 @bindu996  link plz
"Hope(less) did you not see the part where one of the guys (don’t remember his name) said to say the study she found this information, and she scoffed at him like facts don’t matter when talking, and you say the guys don’t use facts"
" @SourceCod33  sorry, but what are you trying to tell or ask me?"
 @bindu996  where
"so show me, i'll show you if u search his full name Kursat christoff pekgoz"
"so show me, i'll show you nevermind, think I got lost I’m my thoughts and kinda just ranted"
i hate how all the girls just hugged themselves and the boys wwwwere all together. It really symbolized the mood of the video. Idont like the feminists they chose. i dont like Derrick.
Fidna get me too'd
same
SJW detected
Yeah
"He was pretty nice in the previous video, but he is shockingly gross in this video."
"cartohead what you just said was a little unnecessary and she was just saying what
came to mind..."
"cartohead look, I’m sorry if I offended you but I’m just standing up for what’s right. Women have been discriminated against since the beginning of time. They’ve faced hardships that  men didn’t even have to think about going through so to start a whole group just to be against feminism because they felt “attacked” by it is so wrong. Goodbye."
"Angry Egalitarian I get why you might feel like women have more privileges than men but this is just us fighting for our rights. We know our worth and the MeToo movement is supposed to allow all women to have a voice and to feel like they can speak up about the sexual abuse that they’ve gone through. Not just sit in silence, suffering with the memory of what happened in fear of the offender harming someone they love or even them if they speak out. This movement isn’t a “witch hunt”. It isn’t supposed to be attacking all men. what you said in the beginning about how history doesn’t effect us is incorrect. If you watched the video, one of the women described her many different experiences with men feeling entitled because of the society we live in and what people told them that they could do because they are male. History still harms us because certain people like Derrick would like to revert back to that “traditional” type of life where men had a lot more rights than women and women were harmed on a daily bases. We don’t need men’s activists because men already have more rights than women and they have for years. I don’t get how some people would think that women have never been discriminated against when it’s right there in the history books."
Him and his greasy ass hair
"cartohead just like he laughed multiple times while the women that were on the feminist side were walking to the seats or talking to him, he laughed at their face"
"cartohead the guy she’s talking about is plain sexist, it’s not okay... he has none of my respect and probably none of hers either, so let her talk abt who she wants to talk abt ❤️"
 Angry Egalitarian  so you are saying bc im a modern day girl I don't face discrimination or abuse of any kind nor do I face hardship. You can be pro mens right but don't act like women problems don't exist bc its convenient for you just like I wouldn't excuse men's problems in the world. Everybody suffers we're just asking for equal rights. Not a hard concept to accept
 @riptide-4028  name the rights you are talking about without name calling and being disrespectful
Nah the Spider-Man jacket was the only cool thing
" @EvieLynne   feminism is a extreme reaction of the way the world used to see women, at first looks valid, but today it's not about the rights of the women anymore... Feminism it's toxic nowdays and Men are reacting, we need equality respecting what is different, not feminism... Love upon all ♥"
 @EvieLynne  What she said was kind of just unnecessary and shitting on people who play video games... she was just saying what came to mind.
" @EvieLynne  Yeah but you also can't ignore men's problems if you were actually trying to fix problems you wouldn't just focus on one side. I'm not attacking you or anything like that, just giving constructive criticism. Men in the past were mostly the one's at wars, losing their brothers, their innocence, and their lives. I'd say that's a lot harder than what most men and women go through."
" @samanthamartinez8086  But don't tell us: ""I bet he plays video games."" So I'm bad because I enjoy playing video games? Most guys play games and it's their escape from tough times, a lot of people are gonna be angry when someone says that video games are a sign that you're a sexist."
 @dhmutronycom9529  So don't act like men's problems don't exist and then we can make a middle ground.
"that guy who is pretty much live in her mom's basement is a sexist not ""men's right activist"""
You can't unless one of them is in the closet
I didn't hear that part can you give me the time stamp?
 @faiyettes  8:35
"What does that mean, “can’t”?  Won’t or not capable?  Is it like the statement “I can’t drive”?  Is it that you haven’t learned? Did you lose your license? Are you drunk?  Or is it like “a male is my friend and my dog is my friend because I am able to respect their boundaries”?"
 Ez G  so youre saying all women are the same and men shouldnt have equal rights? lol ok
I have a girl friend. No not a girlfriend a friend girl😕
Ez G how are all girls cold? I have friends who are guys!
"I have a boy friend, who hates my boyfriend."
 @faiyettes   8:37 - 8:38
they don’t want to be his friends anyways
Some men cant becouse some women always jump to conclusions
I think he can't have any friend. That is not tied. In his basement. 😂
Huh
 @faiyettes   me too
 @sheatemyheartouttt  ty!!
Totally agree.
that’s exactly what i was thinking tho
Ngl me to
same.
Mee too 100%
Well seeing this this aint gonna happen
"Men can be allies but not feminists. Feminism is a movement that is created, theorized and applied by women FOR women. Feminism belongs to women. Maybe if there had been a male ally on the video some of the men right activists would have been more open to hear his opinions, because of all the internalized (and some externalized *cough cough"" dereck) misogyny. But that is exactly what we are trying to prove wrong. When there are spaces given to talk about feminism, it must be a space where female voices are heard and represented.
 
I'm sorry English isn't my first language so I hope I can get my point through ❤"
Love Ya no
THAT’S WHAT I WAS SAYING
elink1 I think it’s the opposite
"​ @martinaguzman2906  That definition may have held up 20 years ago and like any movement it changes. Feminism today is a movement centered around social equality for those who are affected by the dehumanization and repression of femininity. 
That includes Women in general but in order for the root of the problem to be effectively addressed it also has to directly include Trans Women, Black Women, Gay Women, NB's, Trans Men, Queer Men, Fem-men, Black Men, even regular old Cis-het White Men, etc. And it has to start with the most dis-enfranchised among us, so we we can move forward together, if we don't our power is divided when ever progress is made. There's a lot historical presidence for this in the US. For example once Feminists got affirmative action passes white women stopped fighting for black women's access to it and that ultimately divided the movement and rendered it powerless to move forward for anyone. We have to stay as uncomfortable as those who are in the most danger in order to create safety for all or any of us."
@starkiller871 It's called Feminism not Womanism. Feminism is a philosophical ideology not a class or gender identity.
Lmaoo
I agree since a feminist man and men's rights woman have another perpective of their belief and we should have seen those too
 @gazlink1   i think you mixed those two up.
Im a feminist man
u had Derrick what else would u ever want
Marti Guzmán men can be feminists... just a man who supports equality among genders... in theory EVERYONE should be a feminist but the word has been twisted in ways it shouldn’t  unfortunately
"There are no men’s right wamen , donut exist"
Me too
Yeah but there are no men’s rights women
EXACTLY.
Adriana Toccoli I would also love to see a a equalist in the middle
People are biased and this is why these things exist :/
"Oskir Tojów noooo I think it would open a more healthy dialogue, in my opinion :p"
Are there any men’s rights women tho
"Marti Guzmán feminisms simply means to be advocating for equality across the gender spectrum. That should not be told to belong to women because I’m doing so you make a man feel like he’s not allowed to advocate for equality. Please don’t twist the word to turn it into something for gatekeeping. It’s for all genders, not just those affected."
Impossible
My thoughts exactly!!!
Strve Sit both genders should have the opportunity to do both.
there's not such thing as feminist men. feminism is for and because of women
They are unicorns 😎
Sameee
Check out Roma army
"Yeah. I like listening to the discussion, but I wish it didn’t have to be two parts and everyone can be pro men and pro women. That’s equality."
I just want to see a man feminist
 @slayerofthegods7171   then I love you
Minist
"Thank you Adriana, I was going to leave this comment, then decided not to.  You're doin' the lawd's werk."
"Yeah, sad part is that they would actually listen to a man"
" @martinaguzman2906  thankyou for proving how toxic modern feminism is, you saved me a job."
No reason to push for diversity
Adriana Toccoli ya thatd be good
That or even a trans/non-binary person lol
Yup
Skyler Ann and where would you find them
Me too I’d love to see that
that's impossible 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
But you guys can defend yourselves!
Roma army
Sydney Bishop if feminism was about equality it would be called eqaulism lol that’s literally the most obvious thing ever
Jah yeah
This is like like asking for a squared circle and a circle square...doesnt exist
 @martinaguzman2906  men can definetly be femenists. the idea of femenism is equal rights.
"Mens right woman would mop the floor with Feministe Man, come on."
When I saw the thumbnail I thought Derrick was a girl
Me too! I was expecting that unfortunately.
"evx2247 they victimize themselves and most men’s rights activists are republicans, they also want to cancel abortion and most men usually deny the fact that the wage gap is a real thing. women still aren’t equal. wake up."
Tbh I'm a human rights person 😂
Which means I'm on both sides to an extent
I disagree
"elink1 no, just no 💖"
yes!! that’s would have been really interesting!
RIGHT
That was I was thinking I think it would cool to ear their opinions
That's quite the switcheroo.
Can't have Karen Straughan on here or she would have nuked the feminists in the first 2 minutes.
SAME
I'm all for women's AND men's rights. They both matter equally.
Dash Man then what the heck am I 😂
Marti Guzmán no because feminism deals with men’s issues too... feminism is not just for women it’s for gender equality as a whole
" @sydneybishop2795  Sure by definition most people are feminists, because most people want equality for all. The thing is that the majority of feminists would rather ONLY talk about the disadvantages of women, and not about the disadvantages of men as well. At least men's rights activists aren't using a word that means equality for all. Men's rights activists aren't using a word that should imply that they talk about all people's rights. Through out the whole video whenever a person talked about a man's disadvantages it wasn't a feminist (even though they are supposed to speak for both genders equality) it was the men's rights activists. Men feel like they need a organization, because feminists (even though they say they stand for all equality) only talk about the women's disadvantages."
 @milk5249  lmao
 @charleejones2447  me
sofia pertile I mean that’s simply untrue
And then there’s Derrick
It's awesome you would consider their opinion. I would have loved to have been part of that.
Replacing Mimi and Derrick
Same
Not really a feminist man because I’ve seen enough of those for my days searching of the internet but a men right woman would be nice
yeesssss
this is why i came here
Same ! :)
" @dashman609  Not true, look up MRA honey badgers, it's a group of men's rights women."
That’ve been f*cking hilarious.
"I definitely would have liked to see a feminist man but you would be hard pressed to find a men's rights woman. There are many good menslib people who want to liberate men from the harmful gender roles they are assigned, but it is a very different movement."
yes yes
This
They are no men's right woman
"Hey guys, have you watched Jubilee's video on Feminists Vs Non-Feminists? That'll satisfy your wishes. Both sides were very mature and open-minded. I loved it."
That is like having a white blm protester and a black cop
 @advocatevarunrathi2831    Some of the most prominent men's rights activists are female. There are a whole team of them who call themselves the Honey Badgers. Just one of them would have destroyed all of these feminists by herself very quickly.
" @bendakstarkiller3407    I agree, which is probably why they chose Derrick. I don't think Jubilee wants to make videos of feminists getting stomped."
" @gazlink1  Ah, sexism at it's finest."
Same
That's something straight out of an anime
Theres no such thing as a feminist male. They are allied but usually they are men who want to pander to the movement created specifically for women. People start tagging along and thats when chaos starts. It was a movement meant for women. Now its a movement for anyone who labels themself as a “feminist”
Lol
" Muhammad Luqman  im biologically female and support both men's rights and women's rights, tf"
Gender equality BUT not as they are doing feminism now
" @heyyyou7052  I've met some 2 and it's true a lot of them want to be housewives, which is fine that's their choice but they want to drag the rest of us in with them. A lot of issues against men come from issues against women. For example, the custody issue comes from wanting women to stay home and TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN while the men GO TO WORK AND PROVIDE. The minute we stop thinking this is a woman's place most issues will be resolved, except for the death row issue which is gonna be a little bit harder to fix."
 @wreckitben1278  I am! I've donated to several charities to open more domestic violence shelters and whatnot. I also support the root of feminism. I think we should all be feminists AND MRAs.
 @charlierogers4915  Beautiful!
"An egalitarian man sure, but not a feminist one. Feminism is NOT about equality; egalitarianism is."
"I was about to comment that, I would've love to be in the feminist side"
" @SquarePenix.  Egalitarianism has subsections that include feminism, MRA, anti-racism, pro LGBTQ, etc. So you would be incorrect..."
right?
nah fr
"Yes, totally"
 @JudeCrescent  what mens issue they're dealing with?
" @ineedmorehobbies4853  domestic violence shelters don't support male victims.
since feminist destroys families I'm all against feminism but I'm all for to support daughters of my sisters and sons of my brothers."
I'm a girl. And I support men's right.
I'ma male feminist
That would've been awesome
AGREED
Watch Gintama ep 58 to 61.
"So Kailtin Bennett and any other sane, supporting, loving man?"
I could have been nice cause that rarely happens
 @martinaguzman2906  Im a male feminist.
But instead we got Derrick
I am a men’s right woman. I believe that men aren’t treated the same as women. Like men can’t have “feelings” and talk to people about them.
 Muhammad Luqman  your misogyny is showing love
" @landismemes4454  i would have to disagre, women are still hyper-sexualized, people always have an instant reaction to not believe them when something terrible happens to them for instance the recent megan thee stallion situation, also women not being able to control what they do with their own bodies"
 @martinaguzman2906  have you ever heard about Karl Marx?
" @martinaguzman2906  It is not internalized misogyny, people just feel more comfortable and more open to listening to a speaker of the other group that shares something in common with them."
" @heyyyou7052  I've never met a single one like that actually, they're probably joking even though that's not funny."
" @sydneybishop2795  Not true. Feminism is for women, MRA is for men. If it were truly for equality everyone should be EGALITARIAN."
 @dashman609  Trust me there are out there.
 @charleejones2447  Yes.
 @neobonney  👏👏👏 What happened to egalitarianism?
 @spamemail1442  The idea of feminism is solely for women.
"Check the other video they made, there is a really similar video to this one with people in those exact positions you mentioned"
voiceless glottal fricative good for you. they’re so toxic.
" @heyyyou7052  I wouldn't consider them mens rights activists, they just try to fit in. Women can be mens rights activists and not be toxic."
TRUE
They exist on tiktok and are at war...yay?
 @gazlink1  wait were can you show me luke actually please
elink1 You couldn’t have contradicted yourself more in a sentence.
Gdog 2k6 roma army is straight up misogynistic
voiceless glottal fricative What I cant understand is that when it’s a men’s rights activist who’s toxic y’all say “There are good and bad people in every community” but then go and judge the whole feminism movement just because you saw one feminist saying things that are toxic.
That's just an L
I wish I was on this episode because the irony in Zach's beliefs INFURIATE ME
Why do I feel like the feminist are going to be like “ why are you helping them?”.
" @theyeetman8436  for the last time, feminism is about equality between men and women and if people are not about that, then they aren't real feminists"
"I know a girl but shes a ""pick me pick me ""girl"
" @a1sha261  EXACTLY, SHE'S NOT A REAL FEMINIST"
Toatly agree
"Feminist man: you're breathtaking
Men's rights woman: No YOU'RE breathtaking"
elink1 no it means they are respectful to women and acknowledge the injustices women still face today
I would’ve been on the men’s rights. That one black girl who laughed when they asked her about men’s rights in the beginning is EXACTLY what I hate about feminists.
"I’m a trans man and I consider myself a feminist, anyone who advocates to equality can be a feminist. I personally call myself one because before I transitioned I experienced and still do sometimes discrimination because of my biological female sex."
"Marti Guzmán I thought feminism wasn’t pro women 
I thought it was pro EQUALITY"
h e y y y o u why would they take away their own rights😂😂😂😂
Yess!!!
There are feminist man but not men's rights woman.
"music monster 

Yes there are."
 @tynakatroberts5117  never seen one.
Sydney Watson would be a good choice for the mens right side
Perfect
Me I’m a men’s rights woman hi!
Otto von Bismarck Uhm I am Hi I am a men’s rights woman
Marahuyo Me Exactly yes I am a men’s rights woman and that is completely correct
"Well, at least a feminist man, because there’s much more of the former than the latter."
Well maybe not men’s right women but yeeeeeee
Yeah me too
Thinking the same thing
Mr seven  I was joking
Yes it would be great
Lol
" @gazlink1  i’m very confused where you got this from, i’m sorry but what you wrote is blatantly sexist. You suggest that a majority of male feminist aren’t actually feminists, whereas female men’s activists are genuine activists. Male feminists were vital for first wave feminists as where women in this movement were at first completely disregarded, but men agreeing with this movement really helped the movement."
"You should come to my 92% white school. The men's rights women are everywhere, overlapping with the homophobic people and lowkey racist people."
YESSS
"wait nvm that’s what feminism is,,, we talk about men’s rights too :0"
I'm a men's rights woman. I would like to see our sides magnified. As a males right activist we dont claim Derrick. He's hos own breed
 @itscallistaboo610  do you claim the rest. Who do you claim
 @aradiamegido7040  the ones who can listen to both sides and empathize with eachother. Being for mens rights and being sexist are 2 different things.
" @itscallistaboo610  I know. But can you give me an example of a person who is an mra you agree with. Like a name. Just wanna know, since it's hard to find good ones."
 @aradiamegido7040  no one will agree with you completely. I still havent found anyone who I personally agree with. I cant tell you which one you would like because it all matters on your beliefs when it comes down to it. But basically any female MRA would probably speak to you better. Men can come up a bit harsh on the matter and are never forced to see both sides unlike female MRA
" @itscallistaboo610  I don't care if your a male or female mra. I just wanna know who you believe in. I know I won't agree with everyone completely.  The reason I ask is because so many people who claim to be mras. Like to hide behind the claim that, there is good ones out there. But I wanna know who these good ones are. They seem to not exist and when I ask I never get an anwser. It's just suspicious that there isn't any good examples. Men's rights activism was created to counter woman's rights."
" @heyyyou7052  I would actually argue that Women are more or less, nowadays, certainly more privileged than men, specifically in the legal system. 

Look at the cases of divorce and custody. More often than not, the woman will always gain custody of the child regardless of fault or situation. 

This is also less so a legal issue and moreso a growing social one: In 'cases' where accusations or allegation of domestic abuse/violence are made, everyone is more likely to believe the woman and 'cancel' the man. This isn't just on a small basis either, look at what happened and is still happening with Johnny Depp and Amber Herd. 

I believe that there needs to be justice and the expectations need to go both ways. Modern day feminists cannot have it both ways. Either you want to be put on a pedestal for being a women (which I disagree with) or you want to be treated equally and have equal rights. That's just how it is."
 @gazlink1  it’s the opposite.
They would literally be simping for the other side
I agree
There was a woman who was a feminist than she became a men’s rights activist and she made a movie to explain what’s happening to men and it was taken down because it was criticized woman so I guess that’s the world
 @gazlink1  Everyone should be feminist and everyone should agree with men's rights
Yessss
Agreed
YEESSSSSSSS
Roma army get her on stage NOW
twelve year old’s would be calling the guy a simp and the girl a pick me. i could already see it
Yeah this was very biased compared to Vice
"If that's the case watch Roma Army, great content creator as she advocates for men and the details she gives is fantastic. Also I understand and respect feminism but I feel too many people out there for both sides use these moments for their own agenda and self-entitlement."
Adriana YESSS
@roma army
Where’s my girl Cristina?!
Honestly I would have hated to see the men agree with him and dismiss the woman
"They should've got Roma Army lol she just would've flamed them, like straight up insulting and everyone would just laugh their ass off"
 @gazlink1  LMFAO WHAT 💀
"I should’ve been there, men’s rights girl right here"
I am a men’s rights woman. Well girl
" @heyyyou7052  SORRY, but those aren't 'MRA WOMEN'."
 @wreckitben1278  Cassie Jaye
 @dashman609  Wrong
yeah that would be awesome
" Muhammad Luqman  Cassie Jaye, Christina Hoff Sommers, Camille Paglia, Cathy Young and that MRA divorce lawyer on TOSH.O"
"This could have gone way better. Everyone there seemed to be interested in dismissing other's opinions rather than acknowledging it. 

I really would love to see more men acknowledging feminism, cuz we still have to smash patriarchy.

I also want to see more feminists actually doing something for men's rights because they keep preaching it's for equality, but end up doing nothing for men."
 @Younoggww   Red pill is the movie u referring to??
Sydney Watson(idk)
 @Rafael-Matheus96  bruh I’m a man who is a feminist and I don’t want to get into their pants... I’m not even interested in woman. I’m gay and have a boyfriend
 @pnk7677  - I didn't mention Gay people because I thought that one was obvious. 😄
"bro, there cant be boy feminists-"
 @mariezantana8388  yeah there can be look at the definition again + I’m a male feminist
I agree
 @Sg6CrossOver  no need to mop the floor with anyone . This kind of mentality is only deviding us more instead of coming together and acknowledging both male and females problems .
 @victoriaidk2917  well said
Look up Honeybadgers. They are an all women men’s right activists.
 @WoWGirl6  can we just say stop comparing all men to each other then i hate hoe feminist do that don't say men say some people and a woman can identify as a man when really a woman i just saying don't act like we're all the same
@Monke Monke please tell me how see we can't speak our mind without being judged but half the time a woman can
@Monke Monke please explain to me
Wth
 David Santos  thank you
" @martinaguzman2906  Feminism can be something a man does. After all, its a fight for equality"
YES SAME
Totally agree.
" @martinaguzman2906  This kind of view is why you have few ""allies"". I'm an extreme left wing men, and I am pro female rights. I believe women still have a long way to go for equality. But I've stopped actively advocating for it because of such fallacies. There's no such a thing as a productive movement that takes gender/race/etc into account more than actual ideas."
Me too. I think both are great if its advocating for the correct things.
 @martinaguzman2906  yes i think thats what they meant! They probably did not know thanks for informing
There is no such thing as a feminist  man LOL there are man that supports feminism
Two words. Chloe Roma
 @wreckitben1278  WRONG WRONG WRONG. @RomaArmy
 @advocatevarunrathi2831  Chloe Roma
IM A MAN RIGHTS WOMAN HIRE ME
Same. That would have been so much better
"Frrrr i was dead defeding both, i feel like what they were disconnecting on was how women and men are visualized in society and tbh I would never want equality in that because I wouldn't want a man to go through the stuggles go through and i wouldn't want a man to go through things women go through i think respect and their understandment should be equalized but the struggles itself i never would want that."
Same
Yes! For sure
Lol yeah
 @gazlink1  mens right woman are woman who hate other woman. mens rights arent a thing because men have always had and have rights 😐 my great grandma only got the right to vote 100 years ago exactly. theres still people around that age
" @pinkshinx  men only got the vote some ~10 years earlier. A large part of the impetus for the suffragettes, to get all women the vote, was that black men had been given the vote before middle/upper class women. A large number were racists - they conveniently ignore this social norm at the time. And again all men were given the vote only about 10 years before. Only landowners could vote, and then all men, but very soon all women too. 
..and my grandmother studied chemistry at Manchester university in the 1930s, and never had a problem having a career in pharmacy. My grandfather's great aunts married Emmilime Pankhurst's twin brothers. 
Do not assume I don't know what I'm talking about. I do. 
Feminism is what happens when you take women's rights and then turn it into complete charlatanism. It's no longer about equality, which anyone with life experience of feminism in practice can tell you.. Erin Pizzey, founder of the women's refuge movement calls herself a men's rights and women's rights advocate. Most activist feminism is female supremacy. There's a reason the word feminazi exists. This is not the movement for equality it started as. Men have always been more disposable. A trend modern feminism proudly keeps up. In every way measurable, men get the worst education. Any gender equality movement would want to address this. Feminism will not, cannot address this, other than to excuse or make the problem worse. It's morally bankrupt. For many, many other reasons too."
"Everyone wishes women's Day 
Only me wishes men's day."
YESSS
Sammeeee i am a male feminist
Shiii me to
"While I can imagine and have heard of men being feminists (sometimes not for very pure reasons), I can hardly imagine a so-called ""men's-rights woman"". Do they even exist??"
" @charlesch3ng  Janice fiamengo, for one."
 @martinaguzman2906  bro the fact that your already pointing that “feminism belongs to women and only women” literally contradicts your statement of men being allies... if there were women who agreed towards these types of things (majority do) especially the points pointed out in this video I’m pre sure u wouldn’t be anyone’s ally 💀
"Most MRA and feminists fights for equality and MRA just want men problems to get solved too, along with the women problems. 
There are many feminist too who are misandrists and just want men hating and ignores men problems and mra are just against them.
Tag does not matter. 
We should help both genders instead of fighting that who is better or who suffers more, we should for equality and HELP all genders. 
I am true feminist and true mra."

 @gazlink1  bruh its the opposite lmao
" @heyyyou7052  yep, true"
 @sydneybishop2795  facts
"For a men's right's activist lady- check out Roma Army on YouTube and TikTok, she's a real one :)"
Totally agree
Am a feminist guy
I was just about to comment this!!
an educated dude vs pick me 😍😍
 @Snowypuriin  hahahaha ur right....
Roma army vs jorobe
 @gazlink1  pardon? Where'd you get that idea
Yes omg
The only men's rights women are trying to impress men. I have met plenty of male and female feminists and mens rights guys but never a mens rights woman
"Difference would've been the woman supporting men's activists would've been smart, but the man would be a desparate guy looking for a hookup"
" @devdutdutta8796  no. I'm a male feminist who really hates the idea of relationships, sex, and anything related."
 @gazlink1  Ive never read a more accurate comment
Preach
"Or feminist man and men’s rights man
Or feminist woman and men’s right woman"
The two exist and the men’s right women is Sydney watson
" @martinaguzman2906  you executed that perfectly. Not going to lie, I did think men could be feminists but after reading your reply I now understand why only women can be feminists."
 @gazlink1  pls this is so funny to read. You sound like you have a side you prefer
That would’ve been funny
I'd like to see a vegan lion.
On the thumbnail I thought Derrick was a woman
 @gazlink1  lmao we know which side you’re on
Roma army
OMG PLEASEEE
 @gazlink1  nah I still want to see
That would be quite interesting 🤔.
Derek was raised by his grandmother and he still lives in her basement to this day!!! 😞 You can tell a woman emasculating him every a very young age!!!
Why couldn't they have no real alpha young males there to deal with these over aggressive hyenas!!! 🤔
a respectful man and a pick me lol
yeah
I completely agree with that. I feel that this kind of makes some people think that all men are men activists and are not feminists. And like-wise.
YES
"Tbh i have never even heard of a men's right activist woman, i know they are out there... i think"
There are feminist man but no men's rights woman
" @martinaguzman2906  I don't agree with this, a fenimist is somebody who beleives that everybody should have the same rights!"
 @martinaguzman2906  feminism is the idea that women should be treated equally to men. equal rights. not one over the other. my dad’s a feminist. he is a lovely man.
Jorobe and Romaarmy
"I’m a woman who supports men’s rights activism so I absolutely agree. Would have loved to hear another woman share her perspective on why she believes it’s important for these groups to exist and why she’s supports men speaking about their issues. I think woman who are deep in the feminist movement don’t look at men as humans first, they see them as men first and that’s part of the problem. And they justify that by saying that’s how men saw women for centuries so it’s okay but two wrongs don’t make a right. That being said I don’t support the groups whose idea of “activism” is hating women the same why I don’t support women’s groups whose idea of “activism” is hating men. That’s not productive. I support groups (male or female) who promote open dialogue and honest discussions of issues that effect their communities and who focus on creative solutions to address those issues. We don’t boost ourselves up by beating the other down. Men and women coexist with each other and we must learn to support each other. We’re all sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers. We’re not that different."
Yass me thinking this that whole time
I know the woman Roma army
Yeah that would’ve given this sm more depth
No actually I am a male and I don't understand that whole men's right thing you have everything you want what do you want else it's like white people rights
Look up Roma army
Or a pickme girl versus feminist
So me and roma or what ever her name is 🤣
Do men's right women exist?
 @sponsaapje3985  yes Roma army
exactly that would of been a lot better
Agreed
 @martinaguzman2906  I believe that feminist movement it start with woman as creaters but is a society movement includes man and woman because affect as bought. Sorry the English
Feminist man probably way easier to find
I'm a men's rights woman 🙌🙌🙌
" @adreareddy1482  just curious, why?"
" @TheFartGod69  
Are u asking me why I'm for men's rights"
Totally agree!!!
 @neliswatwinmxakaza7521  thanks 😊😊😊
" @adreareddy1482  i don’t know in what point you feel attack. I apologize if it was like that but I believe I was defending humans rights (men and woman), so I still want to know why you said I’m a man rights’. If you want to replay me go on I will be willing to do the same."
"Feminism is an advocate for rights of all humans inspite of their gender, sexuality and gender identity. Therefore, feminism IS an advocate for men's rights!!"
Agreeeeeee
Men cant tell women how to be feminine or non feminine and women can’t tell men how to be masculine or non masculine
" @cixia2839  well honestly I see flaws in all humans. This may sound sick but imagine if we didn't have skin just flesh, no features and no private areas we wouldn't be able to differ from a man nor woman only what they did. As Much as I want to say I'm all for human rights...I don't want to fight for either gender because no matter which way u look at it, man or woman, this world is filled
 with sick, awful people 😔😔😔 who I don't think is worthy of fighting for...
I don't wish to fight with u or anyone else because we have the right to freedom of speech, our opinions are how our minds work differently and see the world. I've never met you and I probably will never but I'll dare say that ur probably a good person for fighting for human rights
But I wouldn't..."
That would be SO interesting !
Im a feminist boy🙋‍♂️
 @martinaguzman2906  actually men can be feminists from my perspective itll just be different since they haven't really experienced this
they should've gotten kurtis conner as the male feminist
 @alexjones2519  yeeeeeees kurtistown represent
Same.
" @martinaguzman2906  The “feminist” movement is a sexist movement created to simply oppress men. The idea of equality for both genders is really only a thing in MRA, not feminism. Feminists only goal is to oppress men and not let men be heard."
"This is the first comment, thats not about Derrick"
 @asasdnna3931  everyone hates derrick... lol
Yea same
 @martinaguzman2906  agreed
Roma army anyone
The reason that cant happen. The feminist man would just be accused of wanting to get closer to women. And a men's rights female would be accused of being brainwashed into servitude.
 @cayanimates3602  that's completely fair
Right but some people believe that they actually can't exist lol.
However I don’t think there is those type of women tho
" @landismemes4454  Please, do explain, how are women not oppressed? Maybe, in theory, in many of the countries across the world, the constitutions and laws promote equality.
But it is proven to be not as such in practice and real life.

1. In many places, women working at official positions earn a significantly lower salary than their male counterparts. (I realise that this may not be true in some workplaces, but it is still prevalent in many places)

2. Many people have a bias in them that women are ""inferior"" or not suitable for doing anything other than give birth, raise children, cook food and do household work. 

This often affects other parts of their daily life; they might not go to work because of this. (granted, this has changed a *lot*, many women still get pressure from their families to get married and have kids and quit pursuing their career to take care of the kids)

And relating, to point 1, many women get rejected by employment opportunities solely for the case of being a woman. (although it might be because of the possibility of getting pregnant and all that, but it is still *discriminatory*)

3. Frequent cat-calling, harassment of all types. The way so many women are so frequently harassed, even from a young age shows the level of value so much of the society places on them. Women of all ages fear for their lives and safety every time they walk alone in the street.

You really cannot deny these. Most, if not all, women will agree to these points"
" @DoubleTrDavid  The movement would've started out for women being uplifted, to have equal rights to that of men's.

However, it stands for the equality of all genders, and there technically cannot be any allies here. If you support the idea of equality of all genders, you are, by definition, a feminist. If you consider yourself an ally, ask yourself, an ally to whom? Feminism is for *everyone and every gender*. Reconsider, for, you, by definition, might just be a feminist.

However, i do understand that some people who support equality of all genders do not call themselves as feminists, not wanting to be categorised as irrational and men-hating (which if you do...yikes) and thise stereotypes"
"Check out the movie ""The Redpill"". Its about a woman who checks out both sides. From feminism to MGTOW/men activists. Quite compelling stuff."
Yeah I agree
yea
BRO WE NEED CHLOE ROMA
Awwww yeah
yes
 @martinaguzman2906  what??
Same
 @wreckitben1278   guess I don’t exist
I’m actually both but I feel like ppl who are in the movement of feminism are a joke and make us seem “KAM” vibe and ppl in men’s rights are usually like Derek why can’t they be normal? I like Dark humor and joke about both but it feels like both “movements” have turned toxic and lost meaning
" @pippip8237  Eh the majority of feminists aren't like KAM, like I dont know a single feminist who's like that"
I don't know why Jubilee didn't think of this. There are some great people from both perspectives who they could've asked to speak here
There is actually one deepika narayan Bhardwaj she is a men's right activist you can search her on YouTube
YEESSS 😭🤚
YES
" @dashman609  there are, I searched it up on google"
 @charleejones2447  yea there are
I want to know what woman would want to be a part of men's rights and why. I'd be a little confused on how they based they're beliefs if I'm being perfectly honest. But I'd like to learn why
its like a good dingo pictures film. it aint gonna happen sadly
There’s a lot of feminists that are men?
pick me girl**
 @martinaguzman2906  that's not the point.
Ur pfp says it all lol
 @D.hazard  yours does too lmao
Replace Derrick
Exactyl
@Chronic Masturbation same with lgbtq+ rights. even though you arent apart of it you can still support it
I was literally thinking the same thing
" @gazlink1  Um no, Ive met pro feminist men who are great"
 @hdog2967   oh have you been on tiktok? There’s a lot of them there also a lot of ppl who act like Derek in the men’s rights
It shouldn’t matter what there gender is tho
" @Skye_xox  it kinda of does. It just would have been a more interesting topic and conversation to see a female men rights activist talk amongst ""feminist"" and a male feminist talk amongst ""men's rights activists"""
 @remyfacade  I guess I just don’t care what gender they are I’m just more interested in there arguments
 @gazlink1   tf???
 @gazlink1  So... you don't believe in gender equality?
As a trans person I’ve lived as both 😃
Havent read all the comments but although I saw the name Roma Army pop up no one seemed to have paid attention to it. And the comments about female MRA not existing continue. So I'm here to tell you Roma Army is a woman. And she's advocating for men's rights (MRA). I really like her content. Would love to have seen her in this video.
So a woman vs another woman? Lol
Check this movie out call the red pill on prime
lmao me too
"The thing is, I think there's enough feminist men they could have found, but finding an MRA woman is a lot harder XD"
I love your pfp
 @Mari-im2sk  hi there 👀
I feel that if someone was of the same sex but on the opposite side of the spectrum they could have a better talk and more understand each other
" @martinaguzman2906  feminism is the advocacy for equality for women, you don't have to be women to advocate for women's rights. Femanism is for trying to be equal between the sexes so saying statements signifying that something is only for this or that sex is damaging to the cause and can bring an entirely different point across. I as a man can be a feminist because I believe that women are treated unfairly and advocate for the equal rights of all"
 @gazlink1  What if I'm an advocate for both?
I think I'm a men's right women soo-
Yo
Not gonna happen.. it's a JOKE
BROOOOOO THAT WOULD BE DOPE!!!!
Ikr I was like “why isn’t that there?”
 @martinaguzman2906  No feminism is for equality so both gender can and should members and as a feminist I think we should talk about everyone issues not just women ( even if they have more issues than men in this society)
 @martinaguzman2906  no. Feminism is the movement about women.
 @gazlink1  feminist is a weird way to spell misogynistic
a panel of only male feminists and female mens rights activists would be interesting!
 @gazlink1  Did you even watch the video.......
 @gazlink1  h u h
Yeah you're right
"Well I'm here, I'm a man"
Ay good idea
That is what you can call WAR😂😂😂
"A man can’t be a feminist he can apologize but can’t be a feminist, feminist is a women fight"
 @emmatabachik5662  this makes no sense. The word feminism is about equality for all genders. Feminist women don't seem to get that. It's the literal definition.
40k like💓😲
 @martinaguzman2906  there are many men who support feminism. But the number of women supporting protection or rights for men is near to zero
Roma army
It doesn't exist tho
Yeah
Go to California
the men’s right side would only respect the feminist perspective if it was a man explaining it to them
 @hamiltonstararronburrsir958  I’m a male feminist! Educated that way.
There are
YES
I dont think a men's right women is a thing.
" @sofiapertile5800  bruh, I’m a feminist but also a dude"
" @LiterallyChad  yes, men just dont seem to understand that feminism isnt all about the women, but full equality and no gender stereotypes that are harmful to society."
"""Men's right woman"" bye 💀"
That just wouldn't work lol
 @johnathanparra290  same
That doesn't exists wtf
Yeah me too
SAME
Same
" @martinaguzman2906  Funny enough, many previous comments here claim that feminism is for both women AND men. Others claim that there is no ""true"" feminism but a plethora of different interest groups, which others deny.
Maybe y'all should sit down first and get things in order before preaching your gospel?"
Hard to find both of them...
This
That’s rarely possible for a women to become a men’s rights woman. Just look back on the history of how ppl treated women
Same now that I think about it :)
 @LiterallyChad  fem = woman ....so it pretty much means womanism
I’m a Feminist dude 👍
What if both made a podcast about proving your self worth and being the best you? I’D LOVE THAT!
Just check the AH JD commentaries also FB in general and I see zillions of men's rights men but rarely feminist men. If ever.
YES!
 @wreckitben1278  🍩 exist
" @martinaguzman2906  Are you seriously gatekeeping who can be a feminist now? Feminism isn't about being female, it's about wanting equal rights for everyone regardless of their gender. The existance of male or non-binary feminists doesn't make female feminists any less valid and honestly, as a woman, I wouldn't want anything to do with the movement if it actually ""banned"" men from calling themsalves that."
Ouch
" @martinaguzman2906  saying men can’t be feminists seems crazy to me. We can’t talk about, for example, men being taught to suppress their emotions while silencing and excluding them just because of history and society. They should speak for themselves. Feminism is in favor of them too. They’re not our enemies, even if some of them mistreated us."
 @martinaguzman2906  your statement is exactly why modern feminism isnt about equality.
Hold a discussion with 2 couples discussing this topic
" @martinaguzman2906  in India the pioneer feminists were men. Men are the ones who brought out, popularized and spreaded feminism."
Exactly
" @martinaguzman2906  I disagree, men can be feminists. There is no centralized group or definision that says who can and can't be feminist."
That’s a lot of women to support
"Bruhhh, this would’ve been such an easy middle ground with freaking Derrick."
"If she can’t have reasonable discussion without getting triggered then she should not have come.

I don’t agree with either sides here but the men made logical arguments whereas the women were aggressive and made emotional arguments."
"""I don't think you can be friends with women,"" derrick says after being rejected"
derrick is one of the guys that will live in his moms basement until he’s 43 and thinks he’s superior to everyone
Ngl I ain’t even on any side just watching to see a debate fight 😂 but Derrick made this funny
Whoever invited that Derrick guy really wanted to make men's rights activists sound like lunatics 😂
“finding a girl at all is hard” well yeah it is for you derrick
Derick is like every cliche rolled into one to the point where I'm wondering if he's an actor researching a role.
"When I feel like I can agree with both groups to some extent, then middle ground did a great job."
"From what I see there were Zach and Kursat who were raising a few great poi ts about how men are discriminated against in the court of justice, colleges and etcetera and the women's section were putting out solid facts as well against all the unfair segregation and hostility they face in society but then there's DERRICK🙂🙂. Wow, the embodiement of a reddit moderator. 
Laughing it off when he can't even defend himself and passing it onto his team mates. Chuckling at the very valid arguments raised  as if he were an anime character trying to be the wannabe protagonist. The second hand embarrassment damn."
"The video title should be: ""Men's Rights vs Feminism vs Derrick: Is Toxic Masculinity Real?"""
that was definitely the first time derrick has ever spoken to a woman
oh shi derrick almost spilled the secrets for empathy
"There are so many things I could have said in favor of Men's Rights, this is so frustrating"
Did he really just say “I don’t think you can be friends with a woman so...”(8:34) I’m not even gon hate... that’s just sad bro... I have no words💀
"me: I'm not going to get angry this time
also me: Derric wtf is wrong with you"
Logic vs Emotions
"At the 16:00 point the one lady gets pretty heated about the one percent,of men that actually treat women like that. It’s not common for stuff like that to happen."
"derrick : “finding the right man is not that hard.” 

also derrick: “finding a girl is hard.”"
stop making the derrick comments guys i can't like them all
"That's strange, why would answering the MRAs question make you feel she was triggered? What answer did she give that made you feel as such?"
​ @regisglass5464  she said that she gets angry. That's getting triggered.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  angry about what? What did she have to state that made her angry?
​ @regisglass5464  15:43. What does she say?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus my query, what does she have to give details about that makes her angry, ie, what did the MRA ask? Seems odd you deflect from this."
​ @regisglass5464  he asked where and how. This triggered her.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""where and how"" in regards to what? Again, it seems odd you are so reticent in your answer. Why do so?"
​ @regisglass5464  in regards to harm coming from men.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  apologies but you are still deflecting. Again, kindly write the details the MRA was given when he asked where and how the feminist was harmed?"
​ @regisglass5464  why should I?
​ @DavidW-ng5zv  why not? You just said she was triggered in her answer. I'd like to know what that answer was to see if it is true
​ @regisglass5464  go to 15:43 and watch. She said that she gets upset. That's getting triggered.
I used to agree with MRA here besides Derrick (obvious) but looking back at it it's a average stereotypical trad life that have been debunked by others on Internet from time to time. Only reason ppl agree with him is just bc he's calmer than anyone else lol. The other dude didn't really bring up a lot of important points that much either other than the part ab lack of male focused being from feminist community
"So he just marries random women?
XD"
Not taking a girl to prom really did a number on derrick
 @ponderofluna8345  nah this dude will be forever single
 @namjoonsoldmyjamsfor3dolla404  lol your username and pfp😂😂..and hi armyblink
 @ponderofluna8345  funny of you to assume he’s ever going to get married.
 @aliciamarie2551  bruh LMAOOOOOOO
"He thinks he’s single cause of his HiGh StAnDaRdS but c’mon, we all know it’s the fact that he’s a complete and utter neckbeard"
"Derrick seems like he was a troubled child and is still troubled, the other guys had good points but I feel like Derrick was just bashing them lmaoo"
43 is too generous
Sophia Noel your the type of people that loves to make fun of people and thinks it’s funny until somebody jokes about something you like and then you get upset.
"P A R R O T 

He deserves it"
"I think he's uber sensitive and broken.  Ppl csn get reslly defensive when their perspective is that everyones against them.  Ironically, the toxic masculinity that opresses his working through hurts/problems will likely keep him like that until he has experiences that push him out of that hole"
Venari.x then so do the feminists
P A R R O T he deserves it though
Making fun of poverty isn't ok
"Women are sacred 

Poverty? Who said anything about that?"
P A R R O T are we watching the same video ?? He obviously said very offensive things
"Nah, he will get famous for being a meme guy. With money he will get himself a gold digger. The end."
he literally said girls can find a guy easily but finding a girl is hard like ?? literally just canceled himself out
 @devildoesntcare5549  it’s derrick what do we expect
 @devildoesntcare5549  what kind of math did you do in order to come to the conclusion of that “canceling” eachother out?
 @Medsypookie  ? okay so my mans cant read. girls can find a guy but guys cant find a girl. so...who's the girl with?? hows the guy not being able to find a girl if all girls can just find a guy
What point was he even trying to make with that statement i didn't get it? Women should not get the right to say no to men because if they do he won't be able to get a girlfriend legally?
 @19Amri99  i literally have no clue what you’re trying to say
 @Biggieandtheboys  Maybe if you listened why you would understand it's not the woman's fault 💀
 @catboyInWebs  we have to provide a lot more then women do
 @americancountryball2077  Examples?
" @catboyInWebs  dates, height, sports/athletic, we’re expected to how to do handiwork cars, cabinets, mow, etc"
Where is Reverend Samuels when you need him?🤦🏾
 @americancountryball2077  but..why is that our fault? again my point being if a girl can shake her ass and get any guy she wants then how are so many guys single? yall cant say it's hard and YOU doNt kNOw whAt iTs lIKe when girls and guys both have trouble finding partners???
 @devildoesntcare5549  you missed my point entirely
 @roisincrowe1489  society norms
" @americancountryball2077  I see lots of guys complain about all these expectations, but the thing is that these expectations of “what a real man is” are the result of the patriarchy and feminism is seeking to lessen that burden. Because it acknowledges that men don’t need to be tall, athletic, handy, a breadwinner, to have value and be valid. 

Sure there are some women who have grown up hearing these toxic ideas of how a man needs to be and they’ve internalized that. But most women won’t give a second thought if you know how to fix a car. And that number is only increasing due to feminism shifting societies expectations of what narrow range of rigid traits define a man."
maybe if you showered derrick
 @Biggieandtheboys  i just know ur a derrick
 @jennabulgrin5887  yesss <3
Sadly ive meant men like him
cj222100 I had the exact same thought
"Right, like there's no way people
Like him still exist in this time and bruh if he's real"
 Brandon Bevill  I agree and him being a incel is even worse
"As soon as I saw an overweight, white dude in a Venom hoodie, I thought to myself ""he's going to make us all look bad isn't he?""."
I’m a man and I’m ashamed to be in the same gender as him.
 @Megaman00700  Aleysha is no better than Derrick.
ManFromMars50 lol I wasn’t promoting going there jsut saying if he think they don’t exist the definitely too
 @RoddyPipersCorneas  there’s a difference between viewing reddit posts and making or moderating reddit posts

Honestly
" Liam Tate  Not really the words I would pick, but like the whole 'I'm not like other girls' are sorta related to that."
" Swaggerdagger  more like ""Men remain deaf to all the woman's arguments and remain ignorant"""
" Swaggerdagger  I never said that it was all Men's fault, I just said that the ones in this video didn't even try to comprehend the other said, there are bad issues in the world, but boy's emotions being invalidated because they need to 'man up', and girls being raped/killed for being girls on a daily basis isn't a 'worthy' problem for you?


(sorry for my bad english)"
" Swaggerdagger  I don't understand your point, at all"
" Swaggerdagger  And who's fault is it then? Was it the women's fault? Because they showed too much skin? Because they follow the traditions MEN created? Men created toxic masculinity, men taught woman that men should be a certain way, we are now fighting against that, they aren't saying it's all men's fault."
" Swaggerdagger  neat, do you see any wars now? No. There's no need to keep being 'tought' there's no excuse for that type of masculinity to exist, but people still practice it, and what does that lead us to? Anger issues, and repression and whatnot, we aren't against men or their capacities, we are against hurting woman, or other men, or people, or animals. Toxic masculinity is in the majority created for men and by men, we don't use it as an excuse to blame them, we use it as an explanation on why it should stop. Feminism benefits men females and everything in between"
" @kalciumsthename  that ironic 
Replace women with men and women problems with male problems and you have feminism in a nutshell"
💀💀💀💀
Other than his mother
" @Plaky   nope, but she still has"
Hahahahhaha
and that was also the last time
"And everything would’ve just been feminism bc feminism is about equality not men vs women. A lot of feminists ignore mens issues which is wrong, but “mens rights” ppl just want to ignore womens issues and only care abt what affects them. The division is completely unnecessary."
​ @KSull6736  You're wrong. Feminism is about achieving equality by uplifting women. It's a women's movement.
"I'd like to understand how does he planning on getting a girlfriend without even befriending her first. Be like back in first grade: ""hey, you're my girlfriend now""; Girl ""Okay"" lol"
@Lzb Lmvm how so is feminism disgusting?
"I don't know where is coming from but I think I watched a video a couple month ago where a psychologist also said a woman and a man can't be friends. He said something like in so called friendship one of of the two as romantic feelings towards the other and they're just hoping that at some point the other one would feel the same about them.
I'm not sure I remember well what that psychologist said. Maybe Derrick has read or read the same thing 🤔"
I think he meant like being friends with women like you are with your bro’s
No it’s cause no women want to be his friend
He’s just tryna feel better about the fact that women never talk to him
Aisya McCormick dude I literally didn’t think he said that until I saw ur comment wtf
 Lzb Lmvm  So you don't have any facts of your own? You were asked how is feminism disgusting and all you could do was point to someone else's video. Why are you so threatened by women?
 @maxbilo6191  That's like saying two gay people can't be friends. Or that bisexual people are just doomed to have no friends.
I had to skip back and make sure he actually said that. Like I am shocked.
Then says guys have trouble finding a woman partner 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My bestie is a girl and i can't imagine anyone else on her place
" @nataliemarcellino8670  cries in bisexual loneliness 
Seriously though, I can't believe people think that way"
Feminism and masculinity have both grown into meanings that they were never intended to become😣
 @51075BIGRIGG  Exactly. Derrik is just salty that no woman wanted him. That is why he hates women's rights.
" @alexanderb4818  Lol how so? I stand by my comment, all I see in womens marches is vandalism by the ""protesters"", and all they do is ""protest"" for equal rights which they already have, the pay gap between men and women which is a myth, and abortion aka child murder. And in the process they attack who ever doesnt agree with them, kind of like you right now."
 @agent7426  lmao derick go back to your basement 💀
I think your opinion is awesome
"I dont think he can be friends with ANYBODY, not with that personality LMAO"
that was me
Boo Train no u aren‘t
 @hungyurn8309  what the heck do you mean?
Boo Train I don‘t believe u that you are derric
" @zelfaelkhazen5921  Maybe she was always talking about needing a man he could've been raised by a single mom but if he always saw her with a bunch of men or a bunch of men giving her money etc then................... it makes sense....... Being a single mother is strong being a single parent, in general, is strong, but if you constantly showing your child you're miserable or that you can't really do for yourself and independence isn't really a thing then...... you start having Derricks..... He said he went to church so that ideology could be installed in him."
 @hungyurn8309  I meant that  was my reaction to the video
Same
"Is he wrong? No, he isn't. Women have an extreme advantage when it comes to dating."
Mace Windu care to explain?
" @emilyegly9509  Aside from the blatantly obvious, which I know you know."
"Basically, Women get aasked by men, and they judge men's attractiveness brutally in comparison to how men rate women.


Women respond only to the most handsome men among those rated


Men rate almost all women as average or above average.


Do you see the problem here?"
"Emily Egly it’s harder for a man to find the “right woman” because the girls in this video even say “I get guys asking me for my number and I have to say no because it’s creepy” (or something along the lines of that) it’s hard when it comes to things like that because men question whether or not we are attractive enough for the girl to be attracted to us or even are we nice enough for her, but sometimes we have to be careful because their are gold diggers bout there some “fuck girls” out there as well as there are “fuck boys” but if a woman wants a boyfriend she can get one instantly, men are desperate for a relationship simply because it’s harder for us to find a partner"
Finding a man is easier than finding a girl. Finding the right man is probably as hard as finding the right girl
Comrade Pepe thank you
"Mace Windu The only women who are actually like that are shallow and I don’t want to say disgusting, but it’s true. NOT ALL WOMEN ARE LIKE THAT. I can say the same thing for men as well. I don’t think it is fair to stereotype us like that. We make up half of the people on this earth and not everyone is the same."
Ashna Rahman you worded it better than i could! it’s just as hard for a woman to find a man as it is for a man to find a woman. they don’t need to stereotype women into a bubble of ppl who only go after looks when that’s not the case for all of us
Filip Holm  It may seem harder for men but let’s not pretend there aren’t an equal amount of men and women in this country. I think many men don’t work to be attractive. Did you see the men slouching in boring clothing while the women sat tall and in style? Men can make more of an effort if they want to find a relationship.
" @mike-0451  I really don't understand your claim about how men are judged brutally in terms of attractiveness. Many women put way more time into their physical appearance compared to men. So many hours of the day are designated towards makeup, hair, clothing choices etc. This is because it has become standard that men now expect from women in order for them to be considered 'attractive"". Lots of girls tend to be with a guy regardless of his appearance because they don't expect the same level of time for a man to put into looking attractive. Pretty girls end up with ugly guys all the time."
"Mace Windu the problem is men should have higher standards, and women lower. This isnt true in all cases but if you have a million people comming at you cuz they think youre attractive, its kinda hard to fond someone who actually cares. Just like how if you just lunge yourself at all women, you probably wont find one that will want to stay with you. I have a lot opinions on this but these comments are really funny so ima keep reading lol"
assessed David lmaoo u right i was expecting to get like 3 likes but now ppl r battling to the death 😭😂
Most men are thirsty for woman even if she’s a bit big. Most men that are big aren’t getting women lining up for them.
Filip Holm yea people must know the difference 🤷🏻‍♀️
"AwesomeWolf well we don’t get to hide behind makeup, and many women are extremely ugly without it, so it’s not a fair metric to judge us equally"
johan curyff finding a man is easy for a girl but finding the right man.... nah boiii
"Mace Windu tru but that’s becus men are desperate. Women generally end up marrying men who are less attractive then them compared to men who rarely marry women less attractive than them so the hot guy thing
 doesn’t really track"
" @mike-0451  That's not true at all, you see ugly men with pretty women all the time, you rarely ever see an ugly woman with a good looking guy"
Mace Windu alright wallet get back to the garage and fix my car already.
"Mace Windu this is gonna sound harsh but it’s not like you’re gonna see an ugly girl wth a good looking man it’s always the other way around. We don’t objectify when are we care about what they have to say, generally men want sex. So it is hard to find a man who wants to have a deep conversation."
So your the type to like your own comment
lmao same
"Had to like this one...

 damn why are you doing this to me if you allready know the struggle :D"
I’m gonna like this one as a proxy to all the Derrick comments
AnD I cAn’t lIkE yoU gRaMmar aT All tOo!
"Men love Feminist bashing
Women love incel bashing(I do it too though)
We live in a polarised society 😂😂"
 @tromboner6061  :awesome:
HHAHAHAHAAH same
Why tf are ppl hating on Derrick
BAHAHAHAH
Lmaoooo
Consensus is the only way to progress.
"i don't like seeing the genders fighting against each other, but i can't but help find this entertaining"
"“Are you comparing women to children?” 

She was READY to break Derrick at that moment"
"Me reading the comments before watching the video: who’s Derek

See’s a short white boy dressed in garage clothes looking like he lives in his mom’s basement: oh😐"
When talking about equality there needs to also be a group that represents men. All genders are affected by inequality in different ways. But the people they've chosen to represent the men are an absolute embarrassment.
"As a dude, I am so disappointed."
derrick looks like he got all his info from reddit
did he say that he wanted to go back where women were literally baby making machines?
"the feminists just keep talking about womens rights. This vid is about men explaining men's rights, yea? So why am i hearing this beautiful lady talk about tampons? lol you taking men using mens rights to attack feminism way too seriously what did they say that was so angry?"
Lmao “I didn’t bring notes/names” so you came to a debate with no facts? 😂😂
"“I can protect myself, I am very capable of doing what I need to do”

Derek: ok sure"
"Derrick: I am incel

Also derrick: I don't hate women, Toxic masculinity doesn't exist"
I don’t know how those women hold back themselves against derick
the girl wearing a black top was looking like she ready to throw derrick across the room LMAO
Derrick is the definition of “I never touched a woman in my life”
Bea was the only one that showed up with an open mind and willing to listen and understand other people’s viewpoints
"The thing that that black woman should realize is that her experience is not necessarily a general experience for every women, men get thrown a bottle, kids too, there's a lot of factors to violence, there is racism, is she sure they wasn't just being racist"
"Me: Sees Derrick
Ahhh, time for a trip in the comments"
The dude in yellow hisses at girls he sees

You need compromise to get the job done.

I was too
I wonder how that would look like.
 @justinnamuco9096  14 jumbo-sized gummy worms would fly out from under that dark blue undershirt.
No she was being a c*nt I don’t need you to protect me I can protect myself just don’t harm me seriously so what am I supposed to do when someone does it I thought you could protect yourself huh 🤔
Mimi popped off 😌
and break him she did. that was amazing i kept replaying that part because i loved it so much
 @zeyzeg  yesss she put him in his place
As she should 💅
ITS DERICK
AHAHA I DID THE SAME THING
That's exactly me
my exact thoughts
why does he talk like Timothee Chalamet 😷😷😷
I did the same thing
Samee
I knew who it was before they introduced him 💀💀💀
Two unterrated comments
" cartohead  dang, which girl hurt you? you're on every single comment thread attacking women 💀"
Best comment
" cartohead  she was actually making good points. All of them did, except Derrick."
@Daniel because coming after a woman's looks is pointing out flaws in my cOrRuPt iDeoLoGy? yeah okay buddy 💀
 cartohead  sorry about that but you dont need to take it out on every single feminist like dang
 @rihze  i think thats derrik
 Letucces Satan  did u even watch the video
" Letucces Satan  yeah sure loke ""women are like children"" and ""we should just go back like it was before under the church!"""
 Letucces Satan  ah yes. The traditional family where the wife was  constantly limited if not periodically beaten
" Letucces Satan  he said ""yes I did compare them"" are we watching the same video here"
prageetha dev 🧢
cartohead well Mimi’s tumblr feed was right
Or 4chan pi board
 cartohead  okay? im sorry that happened to you but i dont understand how that's relevant to you attacking people in threads lol
 cartohead  idk maybe just look at the first reply on this thread lol
when my comment turns into a debate
"​ cartohead  i'm really sorry that that happened to you, but that doesn't mean you can take out your anger on every feminist. this might be hard for you to believe, but most feminists are fighting for EQUALITY, which means that both men and women would have to face consequences for, say, rape."
 @rihze  bad counterpoint
 cartohead  you attacked them first lol. they wouldn't attack back if you didnt attack first.
 @hamon_master1390  yeah whatever i was tired i really dont care
" cartohead  ok, first i want to clarify that i don't want to argue with you, but i'd like to come to an agreement. i understand why you feel that way, but you have to know that not all feminists are against you. real feminists are people who believe in equality between men and women, and that includes giving support to men who have been raped. it's totally fine for you to be angry at the person who raped you and the people who denied you help, but I personally don't think it's right to generalise those few people into an entire group. From most of the perspectives that I've seen, most women don't hate all men just because a few of them are rapists. Of course, there are a few of them who do, but they are seen as ridiculous by most people (including me). 

Too many people have forgotten what feminism really is, but I know that people who treated you the way those 'feminists' did aren't really feminists, because they aren't fighting for equality. 

I genuinely hate that you had to go through that, because no one deserves to be raped. I think the only way to get past this issue is by taking rape cases seriously, regardless of gender. 

Also, have you tried speaking to a therapist? That might help you with some of the trauma"
" cartohead  i said in my last comment that I don't want to have an argument, and you're making it look like you're trying to start one. 

what i meant by them not being real feminists is that feminism is, by definition, the belief that women should be equal to men. if you don't believe that, you aren't a feminist. simple as that. why are you assuming i'm only pretending to care? i genuinely think no one should have to go through rape, regardless of if they're a man or woman. are you only thinking that because i'm a feminist? and if you haven't noticed, i am a feminist who is holding other feminists accountable."
There's 666 likes on this and I don't know if I should ruin it by liking this or not
"​ cartohead  I'm defending feminists who are doing what's right. I'm not defending any toxic feminists. 

and i've already said MULTIPLE TIMES that i'm not having an argument with you, and here you are, trying to pick a fight. What a surprise! Stop it. I'm not interested."
Is my. Cousin a Derrick .......
4chan.
 @rihze  lol
 Just about Mc Fu*king had it  i havent done my research on the gender wage gap yet so i can't say whether it exists. i sort of dont believe in male privilege but again i have not done any proper research. if you're willing to educate me about those topics then i'll be happy to listen
" cartohead  no, i didnt say you were a misogynist, you came up with that conclusion yourself. i never said you hated women. you hate feminists though, which is your problem. anyways,  women cant have toxic masculinity lol, and im not projecting hate to anyone. you really need to chill out lol, you're making things way bigger than they need to be for no reason, you look childish.
all im saying is, if you want 'mens rights' you need to stop hating on feminists."
 @tmpinc.7782  Many say that the sexual liberation liberated men more than it did women - because now men can get the milk for free without buying the cow. Women giving away sex without commitment and without getting cash in hand is comparable to a prostitute who does not get paid for her services.
Gabriel That argument just doesn’t hold up. Women aren’t meant for pleasure just as much as men aren’t. People are people and they do more than just sex. They have jobs and friends and family and hobbies.
Listen we did not get to hear the entire story. Babymaking machines were cavemen days. Not modern society.
"wowwww ok i was thinking about taking this down but there are actual (some) valid points (arguments) so ima keep it up to see what people think. so pleasseee be kind. i did not mean for this to make people heated. i was just expressing my opinion. i honestly don’t care if you do so too, but some people are just.. not giving good points and sounding arrogant."
"Gabriel thats a good point , i see what you mean"
Paige Owens i agree about what you said too about the people are people.
"Commi true, but i was talking about when he said he wanted to go back. but i still agree. but what he said just did not sound right."
 @DemonsCrest1  some women want to experiment before they settle some dont want to settle and thats it but to call them unpaid prostitute is just so wrong. I understamd that you may view women in certain way but dont bring them down not all have to be the same lets just respect each other. is it that hard?
"​ @milendop2769 

some women want to experiment before they settle some dont want to settle and thats it but to call them unpaid prostitute is just so wrong. I understamd that you may view women in certain way but dont bring them down not all have to be the same lets just respect each other. is it that hard?

Who said women all need to be the same? Women don't all need to be the same, and women are free to do what they want with their lives. If women want to ""experiment"" in their 20s and 30s till they are ready to settle down, then that is their choice. And if men want to help these women ""experiment"" and not have to pay them for the pleasure, then that is their choice too. But pretending that this behavior is virtuous and deserving of respect is just silly.

There are reasons why men do not want to marry women with lots of ""experience"", and reasons why women do not like having these women in their circles either. ""Experimenting"" lowers a woman's ability to pair bond and remain faithful (which is why men say ""you can't turn a ho into housewife""), and women don't like having a ""sexually liberated"" friend in their circles because this puts their own relationships at risk. This is why it is primarily women who slut shame other women.

In the past, women would save sex until marriage - not only to demonstrate that they had self-restraint and to show others that they took the life-long commitment seriously - but also to be able to gift their husbands with their very first time. To show their husbands that they were special to them, that they were important to them, and that they were different to all other men. This behavior was something to be admired and is why both temperance and chastity are part of the 7 classic virtues. Today women are encouraged to give into hedonistic desire and to pretend that having sex with their husband is somehow meaningful. Even after they have given it away multiple times to multiple men - sometimes even complete strangers - before they gave it to you. Do you believe this new behavior equally worthy of respect?

I find it interesting how you think being a compared to prostitute is an insult, but think that a woman ""experimenting"" with her body is just fine. No one has a problem with prostitutes because they are engaging in commence and participating in a monetary exchange with another person. They are repulsed by prostitutes because of their behavior and their lack of values. Which sadly is a growing commonality shared by many modern women."
Jaybluchu uwu yes that what he is saying. Who raised him I am sorry for hi. And the women in his life. Omg
Gabriel so im a actually really curious. So women who have sex with others before marriage are not deserving of respect but it’s perfectly fine for men to sleep around before settling down if they ever decide to do so? How exactly is that fair when first of all a women’s first time is usually NOT that great for us. I don’t understand why women need to remain untouched to deserve respect but men can go out an sleep around. Are you telling me that you actually think that’s ok? I really want to know.
@PC 2020 You aknowledge that it's better having men and women protecting each other? Many women that said they are capable have been asaulted.
I wanted to smack him through the screen
" @sleepypigeon8560  What's your point? People who get assaulted can be body builders and professional fighters, they still get assaulted. Terry Crews has been sexually assaulted and he knew he could handle himself well in a fight, but he chose not too because he knew the situation can escalate. Some people do fight off attackers. So again, I don't understand the point you're trying to make?"
" @zeefaaldown3231  Exactly. Sleepy Pigeon, you don't seem like you look through all the cracks of assault."
" @zeefaaldown3231  I'm centering in female because it's the theme they are talking about, I know theres all kinds of people who also need to be protected"
"Most women say they want a man who can/will protect them. This is one of the reasons why they say they prefer a tall, strong man. They feel like a short, small guy cannot protect them. And I wish people could talk about other things said in the videos without talking about Derek. The people who farted him strategically put him there to make the MRA side seem terrible and illogical (even though they have valid arguments). They could’ve done the same with an illogical radical/ man-hating feminist, but they didn’t.

Edit: chose* him, not “farted him”"
I thought so too
"I wish she would have,for all of us"
Who wasn't tho lol
"She couldn’t lift him off the ground, both because she is a woman and he is 600kilos"
derrick is the best
" @biertjewithmenno886  lol 😆
talk about mixed feelings"
AS SHE SHOULD!
 @biertjewithmenno886  Just because she's a woman she can't lift him?

 @idroppedmycroissant5735  I don't care about your savings. Just carry on with your day.
" @i_like_pink9699  exactly, shush 🤫"
" @malachistice8111  no, it’s not like a football match that you can only support one side and hate the other it might seem like mixed feelings to you because you don’t understand this premise. But to me, my feelings are extremely clear."

@Anonymous Goat🏳️‍🌈 same
wish she had
"dude i was ready too, i was staring to sweat and shake just hearing him talk nonsense"
Well why would a women want to be touched by him? 😂💜
I mean he literally called himself that so points for listening I guess
Derrick is expressing his emotions in what he believes is right just because you are all insecure about urselves don’t mean you should spring your anger onto him aha
 @matthewmorris7108  yeah what he believes is right is totally wrong and is disrespectful towards women. 😑💜
 @matthewmorris7108  I’m not even insecure. His opinion is basically him tryna control woman . And then he complains on why he don’t have a wife or a gf . Like no . Why y’all wanna control woman so much 😩? Like stfu .
 @smugnick5458  I’m glad he knows as well tf🤨
"I think this is the first time he’s talked to a woman tbh

Other than his mother of course"
 @kalervo3669  🤣🤣🤣🤣💜
 @matthewmorris7108  Um.....
" @matthewmorris7108  Derrick blames women for his celibacy. That is what an INCEL is - Involuntary Celibate. These forums for Incels are filled with misogyny, misanthropy, resentment, a sense of entitlement to sex. Since 2014 there have been at least 6 mass murders resulting  in 44 deaths by men who have either self-identified as incels or who had mentioned incel-related names and writings in their private writings or Internet postings.
Beginning in 2018, the incel ideology has increasingly been described as a terrorism threat, and a February 2020 attack in Toronto, Canada became the first instance of allegedly incel-related violence to be prosecuted as an act of terrorism.

I cringed when he mentioned he was an Incel!"
So did the French guy tho. He just stood his ground on certain things
Lmao
Literally what I did omg 😂
Same😂
"@Jeff B ahh, I see we found Derrick's boyfriend."
@Jeff B I'm gay; what's your excuse?
 @lucid6891  his hat
" @akramt5560  I get what you are saying, and it makes me really sad because this isn't what most feminists believe. The extreme ones, the ones you see in the media, are often male hating. But a lot of actual feminists that represent what I believe is feminism advocate for men too. I know I do. Take Nomas for example as an organization. It deals with sexism on both sides, homophobia, and other issues. It just sucks that a lot of the media is pushing bad feminism through because it is more interesting and will sell better."
" @josephinemoser7213  na its only pushed more in the media is because they make a fool of themselves, one guy who was on some sjw rally kicked a woman in the face for questioning him about his views

he was on a womens rights rally i think, but other than that i agree with every thing you said"
When he said he is a youtuber 🤦‍♂️😂😂😂
and then says that men can't find girlfriends
What do not harm me but i can protect myself
Derrick is like the one person in every movie that everyone hates...
Derrick needs to get over himself. He laughed at them for what they believed in. And he was so sarcastic when one of the girls said she doesn’t need him to protect her just not to hurt her.
When the men used logic and the women were provided with nothing but fact. The women came in with an emotionally derived response to bash at men cuz they felt sad.
Derrick told his mom to pick him up after that video
Women: are you comparing me to a baby?               Derrick: uncomfortable looks as camera* “hey man can we cut” 😂
Wasn't Derrick the one who was in a video in which people could ask questions to an incel (Derrick)?
14:00 no way she said illogical thinking on behalf of the men💀
"oh God, the way Derrick looks at those women and says things with a sarcastic undertone like 100% of sure I CAN'T"
They could have found a female men’s rights activist because this just feels like men vs women
Who ever choose Derrick should be worried about their job haha😊
Can u do another vis about this topic
I'm tryna scroll through the comments to find a discussion but everybody just out here insulting Derrick. Come for the conversations stay for the clowning on Derrick.
Jesus Christ Derrick get back in the basement
the guys looking at them and trying to figure out the best way to explain themselves without hurting the feelings of the females
"“I feel empathy for the other side”

Derrick: hesitates"
"Derrick: 
Me: ""I'm annoyed."""
"I have seen many people on this show, some I disagreed with and some made me even angry, but Derrick is next level.
Even when he is not talking, his body language is repelling. He is very ignorant, yet snug and arrogant. He does not have much to say, but the few general ideas he is saying with such confidence.
But it really seems that he is just a lost soul and cannot help but feel bad for him."
"Wow hearing ""mens rights"" brings aggression we have given women to much power"
"No one:
Not even my dad:
Derrick: I’m an incel advocate"
 @ChildOfSun23  ew
 @ChildOfSun23  no...he doesn’t
 @ChildOfSun23  it's not just that I mean did u see how he was laughing when that woman was talking about how she was sexual assaulted I mean that not a nice guy that's a physco
 @ChildOfSun23  you should be on the r/niceguys
" @ChildOfSun23  also, they’re not entitled to women. If a woman says no, it’s no, it’s because they don’t like him in some way. Imagine a person with a really bad personality asked you out. Would you say yes? If not, why? By your logic, you’d have to give ‘em a chance?"
" @-ana_banana-2098  hell nah, I'm done with reddit. It's way too toxic and everyone downvotes me when I speak fax."
 @ChildOfSun23  ARE YOU SERIOUS-
 @ChildOfSun23  🤨did you even watch the video...
 @mansisampada7546  yea I'm just not bullying and hating
 @ChildOfSun23  gee can’t imagine why
" @ChildOfSun23  The way you refer to women as ‘thots’ simply because they say no to any advance really irks me. Women have the right to say no, same as you. Women can be picky if they’d like, men can as well. We all have our preferences."
" @ChildOfSun23  I agree no one is perfect but everyone has their own qualities of what they want in a partner. It’s not being picky it’s having a preference. I must say some preferences do seem out of proportion like height, attractiveness, etc but that’s a quality that may influence someone’s perspective. By the way I am in no way attacking or forwarding hate towards you I just want to inform you more of the topic which you have a choice to ignore or not."
" @autumnperez6232  And It boils my blood when I here people say ""women aren't obligated to like you"" OK but I'm saying give guys a chance."
 @ChildOfSun23  ew
" @ChildOfSun23  NO woman owes ANY man anything. they can be as picky as they like. they can reject as many guys as they like. it’s THEIR choice. and i’m pretty sure if almost every girl he goes up to rejects him, HES the problem, not them."
" @ChildOfSun23  no woman owes u or any guy anything. they don’t have to give anyone a chance if they don’t want to. if no girls are giving u a chance, maybe ur the problem."
 @nadaham3427  why you over here defending thots. Are sus or something bro?
" @ChildOfSun23  If a person who has a terrible personality and you genuinely dislike would you date them? According to your logic, you should because you need to give them a chance."
 @ChildOfSun23  nobody is defending u that’s a lie
 @ChildOfSun23  i bet its smaallllll.
hes the type of person to be waiting in a long line for food and then decides what he wants when hes in the front.
 @ChildOfSun23  Who hurt you my guy? I’m guessing she didn’t pick you🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
didn't the girl at the beggining say that when she heard men's rights (an opinion) she laughs?
" @sparklez1765  Yeah and the reason for that is that men have never been oppressed by women. They're been treated badly when it comes to custody battles and other legitimate issues that I believe need to be tackled. However, women are constantly oppressed by both the system and men. We are constantly violated and are speaking out against that. Meanwhile, mens' rights activists usually speak as a reaction to feminism, out of getting their ego threatened, like one of the ladies in the video mentioned. These mens' rights activists advocate against feminism, not for mens' rights. Other than that, there's a big difference between invalidating the abuse that Alyesha and many other women experience and laughing because mens' rights activists are speaking out against oppression from feminists, which simply does not exist. Instead of attacking feminism, it would be much better if Kursat and other men with legitimate concerns advocate for mens' rights in a way that is not meant to shut feminists up."
Women say they don’t need protection from men but would get upset if you see them in trouble and just walked past her
 @hyunicorn691  ok
" @hyunicorn691  really men have never been oppressed by women? Seriously? You do know that a good bit of feminist are oppressing men right? And the system oppressing women? I mean in certain areas that is true, but in other areas that’s just completely wrong, such as rape, when a man is accused of raping a women (with evidence) he gets jail time, but when a women falsely accuses a man for raping her, when in truth she raped him, she gets off fine while he gets out behind bars with little to know evidence against him"
" @KHEENGS  We wouldn't need your help if there wasn't another man causing the problem. I understand that you might feel like those are contradictory, but they aren't. We just need men to not impose the constant threat that they do on us. In order to achieve that, we are reaching out to men who are aware of these issues in order for them to talk to other men and set the standards for their behaviour. Unfortunately, this needs to be done because a lot of men are more likely to listen to other men as opposed to listening to the women they abuse."
" @crazedmadman05  Men have never been oppressed by women. I do agree that the system has been unfair in various valid issues, such as crime sentences and custody battles. However, what I'm saying is that these valid issues were not caused by women, they were caused by men. Women have never had enough power in society to speak out for their rights and make change, let alone oppress men. I do agree with you that there have been cases of women emotionally abusing men and falsely accusing them of rape (which is completely unfair and disgusting), but I would like you to not use that to invalidate the feminist movement. We aren't trying to abuse men or harm them, we are just tired of the oppression and the constant physical threat caused by a lot of men. The case of a woman falsely accusing a man of rape is completely unjustified on her part and disgusts me, but I'm glad that you mentioned rape. Legitimate rape is so much more common than false accusations. If rape (against women) wasn't so common, these accusations wouldn't have been believed so easily. Also, keep in mind that there are a lot of cases where a woman who was raped is not believed. The majority of rape cases go unreported and no action is taken because the man enforces either a physical or emotional threat. Let's tackle the immediate issue of rape against women and also speak out against the disgusting action of falsely accusing someone. On that note, we need to tackle mens' rape of boys as well, because it is also common and not frequently addressed."
 @KHEENGS  that is because if a fellow human walked by you when you were struggling you might be annoyed right? What she means is we don’t need to constrict and place laws on what women can and can’t do
 @Ben-vl5ew  the laws were placed by our ancestors so what are we to do about it?
" @KHEENGS  There's no way you're comparing women to white supremacists. Men are the ones who have had the power to control and abuse women as well as other men and boys. Your entire comment is not logical. I never stated that ""all men are to blame""; I also addressed some of the issues that affect men. It seems like you are getting defensive instead of actually addressing the issue."
" @hyunicorn691  my ancestors didn’t live in caves. At least not the ones who gave us our traditions. You are the one who’s defensive, you want me to see women as my equal but also want me to protect and provide for them. It can’t be both"
" @KHEENGS  When did I say anything about providing for women? I am saying that I need men to stop hurting women. We won't need any form of protection from men, we just need them to stop the abuse and the misogyny."
 @crazedmadman05  men aren't oppressed at all.
 @jeffreygames6066  I can’t tell if your sarcastic or not...
" @KHEENGS  thats called being a horrible person in general. if you see someone who got hit by a car but you just ignore it, see someone getting robbed but just ignore it, you're just a terrible human being."
 @Sarah-hx8hj  I would and I can ignore it if the person prior to this has told me she doesn’t need my help. That’s called minding my business. Or are you saying women are not smart enough to make decisions for themselves
" @KHEENGS  i mean if you see a person passed out, bleeding on the ground, clearly unable to make decisions for themself and still choose to ignore it, then youre just being a terrible person. i didnt need your help then, but if i cant make decisions for myself, intoxicated or whatnot and clearly need help but you choose not to. thats not minding your business, thats being part of the problem."
" @Sarah-hx8hj  are you my sister, one of my wives, my mother or any of my female relatives? I don’t know you so I would stay away especially a white woman for that matter. There’s no way I’m going to jail just because you couldn’t handle your drink"
 @KHEENGS  lmaoo im not white. so youd willingly leave a stranger along on the streets? when theyre obviously in need? and i didnt just say drunk. i said bleeding out. you see someone with a head wound bleeding profusely and you leave them there to die? not very nice of you id say.
" @hyunicorn691  kinda wrong, it isn’t an ego thing its actual problems, and state and example of the system oppressing you. I can bring up one of me, that thankfully turned out well."
" @hyunicorn691  you do realize that not everything in the world that is bad has to do with men right? Seems alot like you just blame men for your problems, and you don’t analyse the situation carefully. Not saying men don’t rape, im just saying you are making it seem like women don’t rape. Its like getting a scholarship and thanking all the women in the building, who sabotaged your test grades every chances they got, but then hating the men who did the same thing. Its the action we should be angry at, not which particular group is doing it more."
" @hyunicorn691  also, you say rape in women is common. Don’t you realized that those statistics are of reported cases, and also that false accusations can be gratified, even if it false? The thing is, the court is likely to believe the victim once they are female. We want to change that. Not to the opposite, but to the goldilocks zone. Where we analyse information given, and turn down stories with little to no evidence of it happening. Sure, maybe people who have actually been raped that just have no proof will be left without any compensation, but it lowers the chance of falsely imprisoning people. Being in prison for rape, especially if you are male, is gonna be a rough time."
" @hyunicorn691  read your msges you say you never said men are to blame, however, you refuse to accept that it isn’t just men attack people and it isn’t all men attacking people.  You also find it hard to believe that men have been oppressed as well. You guys have all the power in the world to speak out, you guys are half the population for christ sake. Also i hate when you say we are, invalidating the movement, while the movement clearly has no base since feminists are acting like the same people they are supposedly oppressed by. Which is why, we don’t want you to tip the scales in anyones favor, because power corrupts."
 @Sarah-hx8hj  you want me to lie and say I would help? But I won’t not always because of the person dies I would be held responsible
" @KHEENGS   man or woman, you should DO something about it. i would be upset if i saw you walk by. but we dont need to be protected by you. we aren't children. if you see ANYONE in trouble, help them. are you saying you wouldnt be upset if you were being attacked/harassed, and a bypasser just stared and moved on? talk about decency."
" @KHEENGS  honey... you dont need to be able to fight to be a man... thats stereotypical. men do gain muscle faster, but not every man has an eight pack and goes to the gym every day."
" @tjonsmith6365  ""i know a guy on facebook."""
 @blou9102  I would be upset but I would understand why he walked passed.
 @blou9102  you do need to know how to fight because you don’t know which asshole is going to come your way. Better to have fighting skills and not need it than need it and not have it. My country don’t have guns so there’s that
 @KHEENGS  so? doesnt mean you arent a man tho
 @blou9102  it does
" @hyunicorn691  while i beleive what you say, dismissing all men's right activism as a reaction comes of as a little bit dishonest. every group has its demographic. just because there's men's rights activism does not invalidate feminist issues."
" @tjonsmith6365  Yes, but we aren’t saying that everything bad in the world has to do with men, but we’re saying that there is a disproportionate amount of violence and abuse caused by men against women. Some disgusting women do rape, and that is a valid point to be raising awareness for. However, it does not invalidate the claim that a large amount of men perform acts of violence and abuse against women.
I understand where you’re coming from, but please keep in mind that it isn’t a pie chart. Negative acts don’t cancel out. The acts of rape conducted by women do not cancel out those committed by men. In addition to that, women are speaking out of fear, because we are taught to always fear men. We don’t want to constantly live under the threat of a man abusing us. This is not something that men have to face, but it definitely does not invalidate their struggles. It just means that they are going through a different struggle that needs to be addressed."
" @mertpolat8989  There are probably men’s rights activists that advocate for what is essentially feminism, but my issue is that the term was created as a reaction to women speaking out about violations of our rights. Men coined this term after women revolted to get the rights they deserve. So, the entire movement was not created to get more rights for men, and is often used as a refutation for feminism. However, feminism, by definition, advocates for the rights of men and women. Hell, we advocate for the rights of genderfluid people. The movement initially targeted women due to the large disparity between the rights of men and women. At some point, women could neither vote nor perform bank transactions. However, feminism nowadays addressed men’s issues as well. Frankly, I believe that we need more men to be feminists and address the issues they face as men. Feminism is a kind movement, not one that seeks to invalidate the experiences of men :)"
" @tjonsmith6365  I agree that false imprisonment is a valid issue that is unfair towards men. However, it isn’t right for you to ignore the victims of the abuse. The number of reported cases is much lower than the actual amount of rape. The number of convictions is even lower than that. You are addressing a valid issue that does not frequently occur (not as much as rape), and definitely not as a result of culture. However, male violence against women has reached a point where we women are always taught to be cautious of our surroundings and who we talk to. We’re taught to fear men, and this hurts both men and women. It physically hurts women and ruins our lives. It also hurts men in the cases that you’re talking about, in which false accusations occur. Both issues are valid, but one solution can help both sides. By raising awareness and reducing the amount of rape by men against women, we obviously benefit women and provide them with security. A lesser known benefit of this for men is that it will reduce the chances of a false accusation being believed. The false accusations are believed because rape is such a common occurrence. It would be harder to successfully and falsely accuse someone of performing illegal surgeries, for example, because it is a much less common crime. Feminists don’t want to oppress men, and men need to realize that. We don’t want to constantly not be able to trust you out of fear of you abusing us and us getting blamed for trusting you in the first place. If we can all agree that rape is a disgusting violation, then why can’t we just speak up and reduce it?"
 @KHEENGS  youd be held more responsible for ignoring a person in need. doing nothing is just as bad as committing the act.
 @Sarah-hx8hj  held responsible for minding my business? Doing nothing is not as bad. That’s like saying my country Nigeria is just as bad as Nazis because we weren’t involved in ww2
" @KHEENGS  you: sees someone dying on the streets
you: doesnt bother to call police to at least help them
its not ""minding your business"", its actively ignoring problems and situations."
 @Sarah-hx8hj  that’s the very definition of minding my business. If it doesn’t affect me then I don’t care
@Stars falling down for God's applause when Titanic was sinking women should have said men that you to can go you men also humans and that may be men's fault
 @hyunicorn691  corona virus/ social distance made several single women realize how much they needed a man in their lives just for companion ship the I don't need a man card is expired to me Mimi herself said  without physical  touch one is more likely to die earlier she talking about relationship you guys( women) contradict  yourselves it's not weakness to admit that you need an emotionally healthy man/men just as it ain't weakness for a man to be vulnerable and show his emotions.
He laughed because men aren't the only people who hurt women. She completely twisted his argument and didn't listen to him.
 @hyunicorn691  you mean like most feminists do when men put up good arguements?
 @KHEENGS  exactly
 @Sarah-hx8hj  actually if you saw someone getting robbed you'd probably just ignore it due to the fact that you wouldn't be able to do anything to stop it. If you got physical with the robber you'd probably lose and if you called the cops they most likely wouldn't show up in time. It doesn't mean your a bad person it just means that you don't want to risk your life with only a small chance at saving another which is completely understandable.
 @Sarah-hx8hj  it's not his fault your intoxicated or hurt. Why should he help you considering men have helped women before like saving them from drowning and then been accused of rape. Again it's completely understandable.
@Stars falling down for God's applause if men have to go around telling other men to keep it in their pants then you should go around telling girls to keep their legs together. Stop falsely accusing men of rape and we might not have this discussion 🙄.
" @Sarah-hx8hj  don't act like you didn't say intoxicated. Also, if he did help you, or try to and you came to and saw him touching you. You'd think he was trying to take advantage of you instead of help you and then you'd ruin his life by falsely accusing him of rape."
" @totallynottubular6691  well it is horrible that people falsely accuse those who try to help them. but at least call someone else to help. 911? ambulance? fire dept? if you see them in need and completely ignore it, not even calling authorities, youre just being a bad person"
" @totallynottubular6691  why are false accusations the only thing on your mind right now? and he doesnt even have to come directly near me. police exist, you can call for help. also i said bleeding out, not only intoxicated."
 @blou9102  if we aren't children then we should stop acting like them. Stop throwing a tempertantrum just because mommy said no.
" @Sarah-hx8hj  yeah I know you didn't only say intoxicated. Also I know that police exist. But if your bleeding out any nurse will tell you that you don't have time to wait for an ambulance and that you need immediate attention. Also learn the first rule of nursing C.Y.A. and you understand why people wouldn't help you. The rule is Cover Your Ass which means think about the possible consequences before preforming anything. Also, just the accusation of rape is enough to ruin a man's life. Thats why I'm so focused on it."
" @blou9102  [Tangent Time] I'm sorry, anti-racism, hon? You mean the idea that hating white people is somehow the opposite of racism? The ""anti"" to racism is tolerance  or love for fellow people.  [Tangent Over]"
 @hyunicorn691  men did not coin men's rights after  feminism because they don't want women getting the rights we deserve. They created it because they saw women talking about their problems and realized they could do the same and to also because they're  trying to keep us from getting to powerful  because if women didn't have men's rights advocates pulling them back a little bit we would have the same problem right now but just the roles reversed.
 @hyunicorn691  the amount of false accusations are only lower than the amount of actual rape because the false rape accusations are deemed as actual rape and so men accused of rape are put in jail because they gently patted a woman's shoulder because she was crying.
 @Sarah-hx8hj  I know I would be okay with it because if a person was stabbing me they are obviously armed and dangerous and I doubt anyone would want to put their lives at risk
 @totallynottubular6691  reverse racism* im sure you know what i meant
"The women at the beginning was pissed for some reason. He just said ok, I don't know what's wrong w/ it."
 @hyunicorn691  if women would be stronger they would opress man. Think more like you not thinking
Kursat too. He rolled his eyes.
" u don't know me at all lol  I’m not even apart of this argument anymore, I don’t really care, because nothing will actually change anyways🤷"
DOES ANYONE KNOW HIS YT
 @KHEENGS  oh don’t forget how BLM blamed all white people for oppression they never faced
 u don't know me at all lol  how do men just play the victim. Do you not see how just saying that is sexist? Anyone can be a victim.
 u don't know me at all lol  the reason their just using the same old arguements is because nothing changes for them. Their still being oppressed which is not impossible. Men can be systematically oppressed.
 u don't know me at all lol  I'm not overexaggerating. Women are commonly favored in the courtroom and so when they falsely accuse men of rape they win the case.
" u don't know me at all lol  oh and can you leave me alone because I assure you, you can't change my views because I don't believe anyone I talk to in the YouTube comments section I believe your wrong so sorry."
LMAOO
"True fact, he still lives with his mom. He mentioned this in another Jubilee video."

Richard Narvaez when?
So true It was Cringe hearing him say all that face to face with a Feminist saying that online with a comment is a Different statement
He’s embarrassing like when he laughed when they stepped up on the first question. Also of course he had to look like that.
"Jacob Marsteller yeah, they should have. They could of also used a male feminist, it got pretty male vs female at some points rather than activist vs feminist."
"I think it’s because they want to really make sure that both sides have contrasting opinions. Because if this was just men vs feminists, some of the men may be feminists as well."
"Yeah, I think they should do a part 2 and have some females on the men's activist side and male feminists"
Should have replaced Derrick with her
Welcome to feminism
Understandable 🤷🏻‍♀️

 @Maxzes_  Technically yes. We do need computers lol :/
 @thanosalt6980  if we so needed it how were we doing so fine before it was invented
 @Maxzes_  we weren't. Here's an example.. Why do you think the plague killed so many people?

" @Hat-Kid  and no men’s rights activists do not fight for women, they take help away Bcs they start crying"
​ @connerwilkes7008  just like how feminism is only for women.
*too. Let’s learn some basic english before complaining about “women having too much power.”
Your dad must be bad at finding milk
Kyle McKenzie yes lets take my overused joke and use it to attack single moms despite the fact they’re single because of the dads being deadbeats
"“For a guy, finding a girl is like, really hard.”
kind of ironic coming from a guy like Derrick"
"please explain how tf derrick got here, also I commend these women for staying so calm and patient with him 🤣"
16:35 it gave you like video games? name 10 😭😭
"""what if that friend was a woman?"" 
Derrick actually LAUGHS at that possibility"
New title to this: “Derrick being pissed off at women for 24 minutes and 2 seconds”
"the toxic masculinity section, some guys would be fine with showing emotion thing is that is more than just tears that is also getting mad at or with someone and that is what from at least my experience women and most guys cant handle"
@3:44  Her FACE at Derrick 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Derrick: I wouldn't be friends with a woman.
Also derrick: it's so hard to find a woman.




Me : I wonder why 🤔🤦"
I- I generally feel so incredibly bad for Derrick's mom 😭
"Alyesha wasnt even honest on the first statement how is it even possible to find middle ground
?"
"Next time your toilet is clogged, call a female plumber!"
"I would have liked to see a male feminist or a female, male rights activist."
A female mens activist would have made this better than Derrick
"she said when a new movement takes place it seems like an attack when its not but she also said that mens rights movement is an just an attack on women. Also, women are equal, at this point feminism is just trying to push men under the women"
"Pretty sure that men's life is shortened not by hiding émotions all the time, but rather by showing emotions at the wrong time to the wrong folks..."
"Me: this is going to piss me off so much
Also me: clicks video"
"Derrick be like :"" men are biologically stronger"". When hes just a walking meatball god damn"
yeah. I kinda wondered why he was an incel in other videos but he pretty much cleared that up for me
Let me make a claim but can’t give one example to validate that claim. “I didn’t come with research my dude”. What a poor argument and made herself look foolish. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Derrick enters the room. Vine music plays; “I’m an adult virgin”
Its not ironic its actually true
" @ghostspresence2172  I mean yeah, you've got to have a personality, you also have to aware of what the girl is attracted to. The girl may not even be straight but as long as you get along well with people it should be easy."
XDDD TRUE
 @spandildhaka9398  so what is an eligible woman? a woman who listens to a mans every word? a women who isn’t confident? a submissive woman?
ayyeee Kim Jisoo!!!
 dev0n james  I'm pretty sure women do too when you think about it.
 dev0n james  I never understood that - women are way more likely to be friends with anyone and not have some underlying agenda behind it.
 @6fthighgetlifted  I just hope that you're kidding
" @h3llboyyy407  Exactly, there is no malice behind his statement. Most of women have female best friend. Most of men have male best friend."
 dev0n james  Women also have trouble trusting men as friends.
 dev0n james  why ?? :/
"dev0n James that goes both ways my dude quit generalizing, my best friend is a guy but I have girlfriends that will never trust a guy and have trouble even talking to them so it goes both ways"
I really doubt any woman or man would actually want to friend those toxic personalities he actually knows that he's wrong by loughing after every word he says
" dev0n james   This is a sweeping generalization but I find white women to be untrustworthy,  minority women are usually coming from a different place.  Feminism frequently means something entirely different to people based on their ethnicity.  Minorities seek equality, white people seek power.  If you feel entitled to white exceptionalism, like Derrick, you are are going to want power, not equality.  White women are much more likely to lie to try to get their way, its ingrained in white culture. I found it obvious they didn't get a white woman to sit in on this for a reason, for a start she would just degrade Derrick.   ."
"Rowan I.H. Actually we’re talking about Derrick here, an incel, and incels believe men can’t be friend with women without the ulterior motive that they want more than just a friendship from them. They believe they will only ever pursue women for sex or a relationship, never anything platonic and sexless. 

While I believe regular men aren’t like this, since we’re talking about Derrick, he does believe this"
" @rowani.h.5223  I'm not - go find that youtube video where they ask girls and guys if they can just be friends with the opposite sex.  The majority of guys say no.  If there's no potential to date or sleep together a lot of guys don't ""waste their time"" in the ""friendzone""."
"I think if Derrick had some female friends he would probably chill on the involuntarily celibate thing.  If we were able to get whoever we wanted without consent, we wouldn't have old ideals of courtship, church and im guessing he was thinking chivalry as well.  Relationships and sex are voluntary (consent), so him being celibate comes from a place a little deeper on him personally i'm guessing."
"Peter McPartland 

What female would want to be friends with derrick in the first place"
" @h3llboyyy407  no, they don't. I have a male friend... I met him via my sister because they worked together and... Became friends... He introduced me to my ex-boyfriend (didn't work out), I met his girlfriend, we would spend time together and now when I am living abroad we still send each other memes on a regular basis. It's not impossible..."
"Just the fact that he scoffs, because women aren’t equal to him (in his mind), therefore they could never be friends. Even in the incel video he did he says he loves his mom, but she will never be his equal. You have to have some kind of problem, either emotionally or mentally, to think that your moms beneath you (at least a mom that you love and have had a healthy relationship with). I will never be able to understand that... probably because I’m a women and my small mind will never grasp the complicated thought process of a mans brain."
" @exstalle2736  i think the guy is broken and very sensitive.  He pushes the world out.  Aside from his views, his personality might mesh with some people.  He just needs experiences to get out of his perspectives.  A girl who is a friend might be the best thing to happen to him."
 dev0n james  that goes the same way to women. We have difficulty knowing what the men's intentions really are in the friendship
 @beatsilver5266  yes and they're pretty rare.  Also a black widow has nothing to do with not being open to only having a friendship with the opposite sex.
 @6fthighgetlifted  'fraindzooned' why if a girl didn't want to be in relationship with a man she would friendzooning him and maybe I like you I really do but not in a romantic or sexual way I like you as fraind so I 'friendzoon' you as you said what ever that means why I would be the bad person and not everygirl's life is wrapped around getting in a relationship so think of it like that if a girl didn't have sex with a man nor want to do it is not going to degrade or offend your masculinity
 dev0n james  Why though?
" @6fthighgetlifted  if I'm fearing a girl only wants to be friends with me cause I'm rich or have something of value then... idk seems to me like that would impact the friendship. And even if they are rare then I'm still going to wonder whether that 1% is going to happen to me. Yet you never hear of a man doing this do you?
Edit: and this relates to friendship cause typically it's the friendships that escalate to something more."
 @6fthighgetlifted  duude.. thats like the total opposite from where im from. Women just PRETEND to be each others friends more than Men. It goes both ways i think
Ngl Derrick pissed me off 😂
" @genericname8727  why should he if it comes out most of them are inferior to him? Like ask girls these days ""what do you bring to the table that I want that is NOT sex/your body?"" and you will see why guys don't want to treat a girl higher than she's worth."
Umm ok. Is it that you don’t understand why he’s laughing. Or .. you find it offensive or something. Like I don’t understand the point of your comment. Tbh
El Aleph ummmm Derrick scoffed the possibility of a female friend showing he is immature and sexist...not that hard to understand
 @elaleph2677  The point of my comment is to bring attention to the fact that Derrick finds it comical that he or anyone like him (men who believe men and women aren't equal) would ever confide in or be close to a woman like he would a male friend. It's interesting to me that you would have such a difficult time understanding that; it's pretty straightforward and you could have looked at any of the replies to my comment to figure it out.
Kate Gillum whats hard to understand is how you can not understand his point of view. Yet you understand your point of view clearly. Then get offended/confused on how I can’t understand your point of view.
 @catherinesmith5793  If you can't be friend you can't be lovers.
Beth G your not understanding. My comment was to ask why YOU/other women. Don’t understand him. Why your shocked about it. Ect ect. Or is your whole angle that your just offended. Because you didn’t explain anything. You just repeated what he said. Disagreed with his thoughts. Then basically said your offended by it. But my whole thing was why can’t you understand what he’s saying. I think it’s pretty straight forward. And If you would just look in the comments I thought you would have figured it out.
"El Aleph I completely understand his line of thinking. I just think his reasoning is flawed and senseless, so I personally disagree with it. I’m not offended, I’m just explaining why he is incorrect in my opinion. The original comment was supposed to be a joke in the first place."
" @elaleph2677  understanding something and choosing not to agree with something are two different things. What we mean is Derrick's ideas and beliefs are so close-minded. We have heard these opinions so many times so we obviously understand where he is coming from. However, time and time again these ideas have been proven offensive and not effective whatsoever. So, we understand but do not support. It is as simple as that."
Beth G  I respectfully agree
" @elaleph2677  ok the comment was quoting him and was obviously worded as a pretty straightforward joke. Again, it is pretty simple. And yes, Derrick is extremely offensive. I mean, he said himself he believes that his own mother who birthed and raised him will NEVER be his equal. That is truly screwed up."
Kate Gillum ok. If you have nothing to educate me on why it’s flawed or senseless. And have reduced it to just you disagreeing. I have nothing else to say. Of course I did not come to pick fights/pick on people or anything like that. Really I’m just challenging my own ideas by seeing if I’m wrong by talking to people who oppose my views. While also seeing if other people are right by questioning their views and seeing their responses.
Beth G ok I get it the main thing is your offended. I was hoping more for explanations/going deeper into philosophy things like that. Like I said I’m just here to challenge my ideas and challenge others. Then find the truth. But as you explained you understand but are offended. I really have nothing else to say.
"El Aleph I just think his logic about women being lesser than him (including his own mother) and the fact that he didn’t believe women and men were equal was a little misguided. Additionally, the way he presented his facts, with a condescending tone, disgusted me. The comment about “everything being better if we went back to past” was tasteless, especially considering he is a privileged white man sitting amongst black women whose race has been systematically oppressed against in the past. Those are my personal reasons for disagreement. Why do you believe he is in the right?"
 @elaleph2677  ok? I mean I am being specific. I gave examples which explained the flaws.
" @6fthighgetlifted  and I've never known a woman who wanted to be friends without some motive. There is a reason women don't like their man having female friends, they don't even trust each other.."
"Beth G no honestly you only disagreed with it. Called it close minded. And you felt it was offensive. These are not valid points. If someone said not having slaves was close minded that’s not a valid point. If someone said not killing someone was offensive that’s not a valid point. That’s non sensical reasoning. Where your just saying something and then agreeing with what you say. And in this case based on your feelings. How you would feel in x situation. How someone would feel if put in that situation. Ect. Ect. He does not owe any women any friendship. He does not have to be nice to anybody. Just like no women owes him any sexual favors. Just like nobody has to agree with him. What can’t you understand about that? You act like what he’s saying is wrong. When what he is saying in this particular case is right. Whether it’s offensive, disrespectful, or close minded to you doesn’t matter. Objectively nobody owes anybody anything. Because if you reverse it and say he owes you something then it follows that you owe him something and I’m sure you would disagree with that premise. And their is no logistical way someone can owe you something and you owe them nothing. It won’t work out in the long run."
 @D4rk50ul535  I'm literally just talking about willingness to be friends with either sex.  I've never heard a woman say they can't be friends with a guy but I've heard plenty of guys say they don't see the point in being friends with women.
" dev0n james  and that's okay, every person is different but your feelings don't apply to everyone, while you trust dudes as friends some ppl trust girls as friends and just as many people don't consider gender to be a factor and that's fine so long as you respect that diff ppl feel and believe diff things."
All of my best friends are boys and none of my friends are girls. I am a girl.
 @catherinesmith5793  you are just using that male best friend
 @kategillum8694  no he showed that he knows the true nature of female 'friends'.
" @salguodrolyat2594  prove it. Youre judging me based on nothing but your own personal beliefs, so clearly you can't defend that."
 @catherinesmith5793  hey I don't care about your opinions. But I do feel sorry for your so called male 'best friend'. He is expected to pay when you 2 go out for meals out and to protect you from harm on the street. But he doesn't get any sex from you. Basically he is a boyfriend/husband to you without the sex.
 @legrandliseurtri7495  actually if you are a female's friend you will never be her lover
 @rowani.h.5223  if you like him as a friend then you find him ugly.
rata sin lata this is the reason he is single he is too toxic as a person. He makes men look bad
"or ""women being pissed of at derrick for 24 minutes and 2 seconds"""
" @o2175  yall!!! Calm down everyone has a personal pont of view you dont get to say tis wrong or right, SOME feminists tend to get « HYPER » and defensive  bcs some one (a man) has a different opinion. Like bro!"
He doesn't know that most of the relationships (meeting sites aside) begin with a friendship. My guy Derrick will still wait a long time.
he’ll enjoy getting rejected on tinder
" @eudoraace133  Im not sure I got your point. You seem like some bitter person talking about something else. Again Im describing what I Saw. Friendship on itself doesnt cause sex- there is attractivity involved here (which Derreck lacks). So Im commentin people saying Derreck is incel cause of him not wanting to be friends with women. Derreck is incel cause he is unattractive, and if he could possibly get maybe unattractive girl to have sex with him- he doesnt want that."
" @Petarosus   I can barely understand what you typed. Derrick is an incel because he is a sad shrewd human being. Most women see past looks for personality. There is no such thing as  ""an emotional tampon"", it's called being a good friend, and if you see it that way you were never her friend to begin with. When you said ""while getting absolutely zero sex"" you implied that being a good human should be rewarded. Hence why I made my previous statement."
" @eudoraace133  I personally have never seen this take place. I haven't ever seen an attractive woman with an unattractive guy. An I'm not friends with women for sex I'm friends because I care about them and how they feel. I don't think a lot of men ""think they should get rewarded for being there""."
" @Petarosus  friendship doesn't = sex. its more like,
friendship = relationship = intimacy (whether emotional or physical)
You wont be awarded for not being a shitty person, being a decent human should be the normal whether you're friends or not"
 @mimikyumalt  I dont disagree. Intimacy with zero physical attraction- no sex.
 @eudoraace133  Im gonna make it really dumbed down. Women dont want to be seen and treated as just sexual objects. Men dont want to be treated by ANYBODY as asexual objects. For some reason treating men like that is ok in western society.
" @tazer6059  what's your country ? Because I can tell you that in Belgium (my country), really attractive women (I mean, I had that friend, a tall pale blond girl with blue eyes, pretty without any makeup, model-like. Gisel Bundchen with blue eyes and a pale skin. She was with a guy that looked like the singer in the group ""Die Antwoord"", Ninja. She had many guys chasing after her, but still she was with that guy for years. That guy was not rich, he was jobless, not really smart at all, and on drugs also. The case of that friend is really not rare here. It's even pretty common) are often with unattractive guys. Also in Russia it's frequent."
" @Petarosus  well, treating someone like a sexual object even if the person doesn't want it imply a forced interaction. Treating someone as an asexual object just imply an absence of interaction (that you can still search elsewhere). It's like school bullying vs no bullying but you are ignored by everyone. In the first case, you don't have the choice to run away from it. In the second case, it's still not nice for you, but you have the choice to run away and find friends elsewhere (and yes, I am talking as someone who faced 6 years of school bullying for being madly tall, muscular and also really socially awkward. If I had the choice, I still would have preferred 6 years of ignorance and no one talking to me instead of 6 years of bullying. I guess for the women who faces being treated as sexual objects, it's the same. And I am really not treated as a sexual being by most guys since my height makes me slighty unattractive. I just had luck with my boyfriend, but that's all. It's sometimes unpleasant to be treated like I am not a woman, like a ""buddy"", being the girl that no one cares about in a group and something like that. It's frustrating yes. I feel indeed unattractive. But would have I been happy if guys were hitting on me everytime ? Even the displeasant ones ? Even the rude ones like Derrick ? I am not sure.)"
" @alicefaitdescarabistouille924  You make interesting points on many levels. And for the most part I agree with differences you are talking about. Thats why Derrick simply chooses not to have female ""friends"", but he doesnt make victim theatrics. Im honestly during summer, dressed well showing off my bodybuilder body....bothered sometimes once a day by some gay guy....But, its not annoying more than if I was sexually invisible- definitelly not."
" @Petarosus  funny enough, I also have lesbian girls hitting on me (I still have guys sometimes, but clearly I can't say that I am facing ""street harassment"". Though I had some guys being ""scary"" sometimes, an exhibitionist one, and a guy who followed me in the toilet when I was drunk. Thanks that I am strong.). I guess we are not attractive to the opposite gender lol. I don't feel so bothered by it also, like you. But maybe it's because it doesn't happens much ? I mean, I guess that gay guys and lesbian girls don't really know if they can target us, so most of them don't risk an approach. But heterosexual guys would assume heterosexual girls are the majority (and they are right) and may risk an approach. Meaning that an attractive woman will probably face much more attempts than us. And maybe more ""violent"" attempts (like I said, even me who is tall, and also a powerlifter, had to face some problems. Rare honestly, because my shape is not attractive for most guys. But still.), meaning they are really scared ? I guess. The only reason I feel safe when a guy approach me is because I know that I can fight, and that I am strong enough. But if I put myself in the shoes of a tiny girl without any muscles (let's be honest : it's the majority of the women), I guess I wouldn't be so confident about guys targeting me."
 @alicefaitdescarabistouille924  What makes you think Im not attractive to opposite gender? ITs only women usually dont approach (at least in my culture).. even when attracted. gay guys Do.
" @alicefaitdescarabistouille924  Safety part you are obviously right, which is why girls simply give out numbers and then flake on them. We are getting of the subject though ;-)."
 @tazer6059  You're individual experience doesn't make the collective. Good for you for being a good human being.
"women simply are not as funny as men this is not an opinion it is a fact most guys in relationships do not think their gf is funny. Men only ""befriend"" women when there is something to gain like sex."
" @kiyoshi3414  OR interesting to most guys mind. Women usually focus on relatinships about other people, gossiping, theyr emotions and playing victim. Wast majority of men dont give a damm about any of these for the most part."
He’s not friends with anyone
 @Petarosus  r/niceguys
" @alicefaitdescarabistouille924  well it’s Europe so it’s different. It’s not a gender thing but likely more a product of western society placing gender roles on people. In America there’s more attention on societal status whether it be money, looks, popularity,etc. while in Europe there’s less of that and people actually care about personality and character. Of course there’s always exceptions and I’m not speaking for everyone, but it’s just the majority of how western culture thinks. It’s not just intimate relationships, but other things."
 @zombies4evadude24  LOL No they dont.
She brought him into this world she should have taken him back
Derrick is awesome
"Well she was the one to raise him, she failed as a parent so I feel more sorry for him."
nah man his totally cool
IKR if I was his mom I would be too ashamed to admit he was my son
 @dont8038  stop writing it under every comment you’re so embarrassing
 @adelamizerova2420  why did you answer if I'm embarrassing like be quiet bro👍🏾🤐
 @dont8038  i- okay?
his mom is ashamed ill bet
" @dont8038  if he's awesome, then I'm straight"
 @dont8038  definitely not. WHy do you think Derrick is awesome?
" @angelskllz  because he's cool,chill and different and awesome"
 @dont8038  I- he's an incel?? Guess he's just built different.
 @angelskllz  Hes awesome
 @dont8038  Um. Um. Um. ASFDSFDSFDEF DF BYE NOT ME BURSTING OUT IN LAUGHTER
 @angelskllz  SIS IM BURSTING TOO I SWEAR THIS TAMET IS DERRICK ALT ACCOUNT
I’m kinda considered that she has the same views as him
 @sitalvs  Yea at least I'm different from someone being judgmental😁👍🏾.
 @staninsertkpopgroup1181  BYE BECAUSE IT PROBABLY IS
 @sitalvs  a decent no a judgment one and bro don't blow a kiss at me
 @sitalvs  alright bet
 @sitalvs  alright bet
 @dont8038  lol looks like you got insulted by salty people for having a opinion ( a bad opinion)
 @2dguy434  BAHAHHAHAHA
 @thebigblep6718  Periodtttttt
The person who raised him?
Nombie why would you as a woman would want to lower yourself and be under men’s control?!
I wanna see Bill Burr in this thing 😂
yeah 1 of each wouldve been good
Mona __ that’s not what it means to be a men rights activist.
I felt the same way watching this!
 @monagrimm1696  ohhh it's called being rational
we should get kurtis conner our here
 @monagrimm1696  im a female and I agree more with the men then the feminists. At least they don't follow debunked beliefs. We as woman have been oppressed in the past but that doesn't give us the right to commit the same mistakes as men did in the past
 @monagrimm1696  what the hell are you talking about?
how on earth would you get that haha
" @monagrimm1696  bruh there are tons of female MRA's, just like there are tons of male feminists. They made that decision based on whatever life experiences they had, noone forced them to hold those views. Female MRA's aren't under male control in the slightest"
Nombie LMAO 😂 TOP COMMENT
"Honey, feminist would not gonna agreed a man becomes a feminist..."
Hannad Osman not all incels are bad people or hate women
Yea
 @vivianelinden1568  the wage gap wasn't debunked. Those who say that are literally conservatives taking statistics out of context
Please!!!
no one look up the honey badgers or Karen Straughn a group of Australian women who are men’s rights activists
"I mean, it's fairly easy to find a male feminist but women aren't really welcome in many men's rights circles as they're under way more scrutiny"
Nombie feminists go for male rights too. That’s why the title is flawed.
"no one any one with dignity would support  humans rights. Anyone with a spine would acknowledge mens rights would come under this. There are loads of girls from my school that would support men’s rights because they are not scared of being called an ‘incel’, just to do what is right."
"Can someone who has no lived experience of being a woman, be a feminist? 

I think the right  word is ALLY"
" @nic_aya  Feminists focus pretty much entirely on female rights only, the movement is centered around women, and they only end up doing things for men when it clearly helps women as a biproduct. The vast majority of feminists don't do anything because they truly want gender equality and are happy to follow through on causes that will only help men, it always has to benefit women in some shape or form, otherwise it's not worthy of their attention."
"BullShark yeah they don’t hate women they just feel like women are less than them and don’t want to have any type of relationship with them, kinda sounds like they’re not too fond of women"
You mean to tell me that person in the yellow sweater is a man?🤯Lol
"no one one person, Karen DeCrow."
 @RonaldChristy  men can be feminists actually
Some Person would you care to elaborate on how it isn’t debunked?
" @aidangomez8545  ""Some feminists, like Simone de Beauvoir in her seminal text The Second Sex, argue that men cannot be feminists because of the intrinsic differences between the sexes,[17] Separatist feminists also hold this view, arguing that only by rejecting the masculine perspective entirely can feminism allow women to define themselves on their own terms, and that the involvement of men in the feminist movement will inculcate the values of patriarchy into any social change. Some writers[18] hold that men do not suffer the same oppression as women, and as such cannot comprehend women's experience, and as such cannot constructively contribute to feminist movements or concepts""
You should learn more... Did i hear mansplaining?! Too bad..."
SAME!
They exist y’all
 @abi2767  Bill Burr with one side and Amy Schumer with the other.
Definitely! Can we get a part 2?
Nombie same im a male rights activist
 @superstar-lr3un  J.C a documentary maker and feminist was encouraged to make a documentary about MRAs and she eventually through the course of events became an MRA.
We need equity...not feminism or incels.
 @monagrimm1696  that's not at all what means rights advocates for lol.
Probably hard to find a female men’s rights activist
" @superstar-lr3un  There are quite a few. A famous one who started off as a feminist to make a documentary about how silly mens rights are, then became a mens rights activist - then became targeted of hate and even death threats from.the feminists she once used to hang with."
 @sheshenq  the wage gap has been debunked. Those who think it hasn't don't understand averages or economics.
If you give a mouse a cookie
I’m a female male rights activist
exactly my first thought
I would rather like to see a male feminist and a male men’s right activist to see the change in tone when the men’s rights activists are talking to the same gender.
I actually bumped into a group of meninists and a FEMALE yelled in our face about circumcision even though I agreed with her lol
Same
"For how I see it, at times the feminists defended men's right (right to express themselves etc) more than what the male activistis did 😂😅"
"We already got two great female MRAs. Karen Straughan and Erin Pizzey. Look them up.
The offering of MRAs they put on this panel is just terrible. They understand little."
 @monagrimm1696  why would you as a man want to lower yourself and be under women's control.
I don't think that would help in finding middle ground if anything it's exactly what both sides are arguing over the differences between male an female how would a male honestly view a females perspective? If he's never been in her place or vice versa?
kurtis conner: a male feminist
"Loreto Fernandez Uh, I believe that you’re getting feminism confused for another social justice issue. Men can be feminists. It is, technically, the belief for equal rights for everyone."
I’m worried that the female male rights activist may also be a person who also believes in some other questionable things
 @superstar-lr3un  they exist just proves women don't research the other side they just run on emotions
 @abi2767  🤣🤣🤣
 @user-ei7ed6zy9k  you speak words of wisdom my friend.
" @superstar-lr3un  Female MRAs: Karen Straughn (GirlWritesWhat), Alison Tieman (TyphonBlue), Janice Fiamengo (StudioBrule). Just to name 3. Your move."
Well my brother is a feminist and I am  on the Male right  activist side lol
I consider myself to be both
 @superstar-lr3un  Wasn't there one that did a TED talk?
"I thought the same thing! As a female anti-feminist, I would have liked to see someone like me represented."
"That would be an extremely interesting conversation, especially since it's more like a discussion about how each group doesn't see themselves as being oppressed, as opposed to two groups debating what ways they perceive themselves to be disenfranchised or oppressed.  On that same vein I'd like to see female men's rights and feminists discuss and male feminists and men's rights advocates discuss with each other"
O that will be so cool!!!
"traditional MRA spaces tend to be reactionary, misogynistic, and extremely dismissive of any and all feminist issues, so female MRAs are few and far between. But the progressive/feminist spaces I’m in do discuss and take seriously issues that affect men like family court discrimination and the concept of male disposability. You have to go a little left of mainstream liberal feminism to find it though, because unfortunately some feminist spaces are very dismissive of men’s issues even to the point of perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes by making male survivors of rape unwelcome in certain spaces made to support sexual assault survivors."
"You could find male feminists, but there aren't many female MRA's."
Female men's rights activist.
 @superstar-lr3un  What are you going on about? Lots of them exist.
Karen Straun is a awesome male rights activist.
Same!
Mona __  that’s not what it is🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
meymey Gonzalez that is a lie I would respect a woman much more if they have common sense
agreed
I also believe if they had older people  would have helped make the distinction better. no one looks older  than 26.
" @superstar-lr3un they are out there.
One of them made a documentary about changing from being an all out feminist to being an MRE."
Mona __ well a man being a feminist by your logic would make women have control over a man but you don’t mention that part do you?
There's alot of both
What does it matter who delivers the message?
 @loretofernandez2844  no men can be feminist too. We don't need to put modern insights into that term. It's already pretty well defined in social science
"If woman had equal rights on a social level, it would give men the legislative and judicial equality."
A female male rights activist is just a human rights activist. The sides are so polarizing that you can’t have a female only advocating for men’s right and a male only advocating for women’s rights
"Mona __ i know female friends who tell me that men are stronger and better than them, and I tell them that they are capable of anything the want to achieve, that there’s no need to compare themselves to a gender they are equal to, but they don’t change their mind, so yeah, there exist"
no one I know several:(
 @superstar-lr3un  there are female male rights activists. Just like how their male feminist
" @monagrimm1696  Sadly, as Karen said, when a woman talk, people are willing to listen more, then when a men talk about mens rights. This is the reason why more woman are in this mens rights activists. Unlike feminism, it's about mentioning hypocrisy, double standart, unfairness and just wanting equality. Feminists never was about equality. Even the first feminist wave had toxic femininity in and attacked Erin Pizzey, a true feminist, who just wanted open mens shelters."
" @superstar-lr3un  Trust me, there are many female mens rights activist. I am not one activist, but i am for mens rights."
" @firesong7825  @Nikki W Feminists also only support woman who agree with their believes. They do harass, bully and smear other woman who are conservatives, centrist or right. Erin Pizzey is a feminist, a true feminist who also cares a lot for mens rights. She had to move out, cause her and her families life was and still are threatened by feminists whoar mostly radical woman."
"Some Person It’s actually has with many statistics and facts, I feel like the easiest way for you to understand this is to read ‘The Equal Pay Act of 1963’ and also the impact of it since EPA’s enactment."
" @vivianelinden1568  same, i think that now feminism is becoming too much, it's not equal for both sides"
 @pranavg.9811  The problem is that too many men's rights group just sound like woman haters who want to rewind time to where they ruled with an iron fist and were the only ones who could own land or vote.  If it was just dudes talking due process and father's rights to see their kids when they do what they're supposed to do without acting like all mothers are horrible and trying to get over or all victims of rpe and sexual assault are just regretting drunk sex. Too many seem to have the wrong talking heads out their repping them.
Does a female men’s rights activist really exist
no one: like me?
@bull shark then why give them publicity if you don’t want ppl to watch them
 @superstar-lr3un  I advocate for men's rights and I know plenty of other women in my life who would do the same
no one i’m a male rights activist & im a girl 😳
 @user-ei7ed6zy9k  Labels don't help. if a man is sympathetic to women's plight he's nothing other than sympathetic. I'm not particularly fond of either side but let people have their opinions without being labeled.
" @bandeyekhoda3943  nah male feminist are in the mindset of ""maybe if I agree with her she'll touch the tip'"
 @mattwerstler1155  fax
" @monagrimm1696  a female men's rights activist isn't the same as a female being under man's control, it's a female thinking there's a flaw in Feminism and a negative view of men."
 @vivianelinden1568  Get this woman a cookie! Get this woman a truckload of cookies!
Nombie yeah it would have been nice to see that
BullShark they mean in this video
"Mona __ unfortunately, I’ve seen it. I don’t get it either"
Yes! I was hoping they would. I’m sure they could find someone to come in
Nombie for real
"i would have loved to see a female male rights activist, as i kind of consider myself to be an anti-feminist and more on that male rights path"
Sydney Helland yesssss
" @user-ei7ed6zy9k  how do you know tho man? I ain't defendin' nobody but I won't make my mind up about an individual that I haven't met, based on one of his opinions dude."
A male feminist definitely
I'm a male feminist (also known as an equalist)
"Yeah, instead of that incel for sure"
Tf i hope there is no female that would advocate for men's rights smh
Agree
exactly!!!
 @bughelland2052  YESSS
 @bughelland2052  My mayor
"They want 2 very different sides to agree not several slightly different sides to agree. People watch for the debates, argument, hard earned agreements"
" @monagrimm1696  women can be objective. If they see a man being jailed after fighting back against a woman who tried to assault him with a weapon, they can say it's unjust. Or how a guy is accused of rape if both him and his partner are drunk."
" @sheshenq  it was debunked. 

None of the studies accounted for the number hours of worked, risk involved, convenience of hours, death rate at work, ask for promotion, years worked, vacation time . Men on AVERAGE get paid more, because on AVERAGE die more at work (90%+) and work more dangerous. Higher risk means higher reward. Men on AVERAGE work more hours and do more overtime. On AVERAGE work  in crappier conditions. Men on average take less vacation time as well. 
There debunked."
Grace Hubbard Me too dog
Viviane Linden Women are still oppressed every day all over the world. There are in fact female male activists.
I am a female male rights activist.
 @monagrimm1696  lmao subliminal playlist
Great idea!
"Hannad Osman woah there buddy, do u need a hug cuz damn"
Hannad Osman  I don’t think that’s what he’s saying
They do have a vid on this channel pt1
" @sheshenq  

""the wage gap wasn't debunked.""

Of course it was. Unless the State is intervening, businesses will not pay employees a cent more than they absolutely have to. The idea they would volunteer to pay men more than women is a paranoid fantasy.


"" Those who say that are literally conservatives taking statistics out of context""

No, they are economists who do this stuff every day.

But feel free to prove me wrong, by producing evidence of businesses that are breaking the law by paying men more than women for identical work."
Sydney Watson: hold my kangaroo
" @sheshenq  all wage gap statistics do not take into account important factors like; Hours worked, company worked at, skill level, level of employment, high school or university education and amount of paid and unpaid leave. Wage gap statistics are taken as averages between several companies, the data isn't specific and is very broad and taken, most of the time, out of context. The stats are broad and undefined, and cannot be accurately cited in academia, no matter how hard feminists try."
"Yeah they should have asked a Honeybadger to speak for the MRA side. (female MRAs)
And while we're at it, have had her replace Derrick. Muh boi is like an extreme of the movement."
"I think that would have made the conversation more interesting, so that if one of the women or men in this was sexist they would get a wake up call."
Fr facts see why they chose where they are
Sydney Watson :)
 @monagrimm1696  @shoeonhead
"Nombie it has been done, search for ""cenk uygur vs karen straughan "" on youtube."
Hannad Osman why would be supporter of a woman be shown as weak or has no back bone that’s just so ignorant
"YES. THE GUYS NEED SOME HELP TALKING WITH THE GIRLS AND GIRLS NEED HELP WITH THE GUYS. 

(This is coming from a girl that thinks the ladies in this video are crazy)"
Me too
 @monagrimm1696  I'm a female men's rights activist wym? Women are naturally submissive and need a male figure to guide them
ONE female MRA would wipe the floor with those 3.
 @abi2767  you killed me with that haha id pay to see it
"I'm a female who supports men's rights. I have three sons, so of course I want to see a system that is fair to them."
Nombie so 2 pick me's
That would actually be interesting af
 @user-ei7ed6zy9k  take my like
" @ms.rstake_1211  You obviously know little of MRAs. You probably only listen to MRAs as snippets being roasted by Feminists. Many of the most famous and popular MRAs are women. Karen Straughn, Allison Tieman, Hannah Wallen, Janice Fiamengo, and many. more. All are beloved by the MRA community, and regularly invited to speak at MRA events. In fact, all are more popular in the MRA community than any male MRA, except maybe Paul Elam."
Nombie this is California not a normal state
Viviane Linden I respect you so much ❤️
there's no such thing as a male feminist lol or the other way around
CalumDarroch the wage gap HAS NOT been debunked. So tired of hearing this shot from uneducated individuals🙄🙄
yes same!
EXACTLY this is so typical I knew what their ideas were already before they started talking 🤣 it was barely interesting just for the fact that there wasn’t one male feminist or one male rights activist. That would’ve been soooo much more interesting 😂😂
 @stinkoshatter-shield2096  tf r u talking about women lead the mr movement
"There are actually a lot of male feminists and female... how to put it... anti-feminists? 
Anyway, I agree that would make conversation more about ideas of equality rather than women vs men."
 @loretofernandez2844  There are male feminists and they are just as valid - learn some history. In my country (Poland) majority of famous 1st wave feminists were men.
I'm a female male rights activist
" @user-ei7ed6zy9k  .......sexists much. Your one of those people who think ""minorities"" cant be racist"
" @sheshenq  yes, yes it was debunked in fact, I can link many articles that say it's not true including situational numbers such as extra works and such. Women tend to work jobs that arent played a lot which is why the ""wage gap"" came to be, they didnt consider that."
" @sheshenq  also I'm in the center, in fact I'm more towards the left."
" @landya.9258  what about the other way around? Seen many women sexually harass a man and just as many as there woman who are abused by women there are just as many as the opposite 



(I'm what you call a humanist, supporter of feminism, mans right activism and anti- third wave feminism)"
"@Hector's Hymn in Australia, a movie (the red pill)was soon band in all theaters because it was by a woman who was an ex-feminist decided to show the men's right activists as not just evil men and realized they had many good points."
" @monagrimm1696  either you dont understand english or what!!!!!
D
She didn't mean that.did she???"
 @RonaldChristy And why is that ?
Tons of those guys' beliefs are debunked. A lot of their beliefs are /pol memes and historical revisionism.
The wage gap has never been debunked. There's a very long Wikipedia article on it if you're interested in reading.
"Mona __
That not this a all! Sometime boys are right.. Not only women and some women just don’t love the comportement of the women"
Mona __ That’s not what men’s rights means tho lmao
" @sheshenq  Yeah, it has been. When accounting for career selection, hours worked, and time off, the difference is as little as 2-3% in penalthy for women over 50, and 4-5% in favour of women under 30. In other words, fairly negligable. It's only dishonest, unscientific, oranges to apples comparisons that deliver any larger differences."
"If you'd like to see some female MRAs, check out Honey Badger Radio and also the videos put out by Karen Straughn, Hannah Wallen, and (especially) Alison Tieman."
Agree!! I think seeing those view points would've been very interesting!!
"I, as a female, think that men are just as disadvantages as women, but in different areas. I’m not a feminist, or a  male rights activist. Just a person with an opinion. I agreed more with the guys in this than women."
" Frederick Röders  it's not toxic, it's just a bitter pill"
 @sheshenq  the wage gap was heavily debunked because it doesn't focus on money taken out hourly but money taken out of the final paycheck and the statistics mentioned are often related as to why men may get more in the end
"That's illogical. Only a female can be a feminist, and a man can be a feminist ally, but not a feminist. And it's the other way around. I am a white person, i can support and be an ally of black people, but i can never be black, and have their experience."
Agrees
" @monagrimm1696  So feminism is somthing right but male right activists are not?
I can't see your logic here."
Yo bruh I agree
"Mona __ that’s not what it means. you can be a rationalist, an equalist or a relativist, basically seeing things for what they are and not being bias or leaning to one side. I’m done with certain females changing the definition of feminism. Feminism was supposed to be females getting EQUAL rights as men, not being superior or anything of the like. Never to steer away from “control of men” as you say since we live in a very different society compared to those times. Feminism was made to give women a voice. There are women in less fortunate countries who suffer from inequality and here you are blabbering about how a female can’t be a male activist, trying to help the other gender out for a change. Please see this from a different stand point."
Viviane Linden couldn’t have said it better myself
"Loreto Fernandez definition of feminism is the belief that women are a t an equal level to men. If men share that belief, they may call themselves feminists."
Big Daddy Toyota Corolla you ain't a stud buddy
grabs popcorn this comment section gonna be good
 @LS-jk3fk  ok centrist
Agreed
 @monagrimm1696  Wow I can see the willingness to engage in a good faith argument dripping off you
That's what I was hoping as well
" @sheshenq  but it is debunked, because it doesn't take into account that men voluntarily work high pay, high risk jobs, and will also voluntarily work overtime, and are more likely to ask for raises. Women on the other hand do not. That's why the wage gap needs to be measured by industry based on ones that are equal parts men an women. When this is done, women in nursing and education are generally paid more or the same as men. So no, it has been debunked."
" @madae.2183  Then you've not met many men's rights activists. It's typically the opposite. Remember when femenists got a men's day shut down on a college campus, and it was there for men to discuss and deal with suicide (which is extremely high amongst males) as well as other issues that plague men. It had nothing to do with being anti woman, and yet the femenists still had to get it shut down."
" @Money_Schacht  I think I've been misunderstood. I was talking only about the video. I know there are some ""feminists"" that take it in a direction I hate."
"Right? I'm a female men's rights advocate. I'm not much of an activist, but I am more for men's rights because I don't see them being treated fairly. A lot of feminists just try to shut them down."
" Shark S.  She wasn't paid by MRAs. She wanted to make a documentary, asked for help from the feminist community got nothing and was warned not to make this documentary. Hearing about this MRAs crowdfunded her project. So no, she wasn't paid by MRAs. Point still stands though, Cassie was a feminist at the outset is no longer one."
mona grimm you would be surprised how many their are
mona grimm yeah what Ethan Barnes said
Loreto Fernandez I thought being a feminist was male and female having equal rights and didn’t have anything to do with your gender
"emily ruvalcaba I’m female male rights activists and feminist, I just want equal rights. Lol I feel like this is a bunch of people arguing for things they already have"
Devilslayer101 Ally-A
Red HawK15 if there’s a wage gap why don’t companies just hire women cause it would be cheaper?
Nombie im a female MRA
mona grimm I know a woman who lets that happen to her because that’s what her religion says.
" @user-ei7ed6zy9k  its sad how people consider male feminists ""simps"" instead of encouraging them to be one, you're just making it worse than it already is"
I think that would be an interesting change in dynamic and over all conversation. Good idea!
 @gracehubbard5143  why? thays horrible
Some Person the wage gap had been made illegal. Plus if women were payed less companies would take advantage of it and hire them more. Also I’m liberal.
Big Daddy Toyota Corolla Imagine wanting better rights for other humans makes you a ‘simp’. What an awful mindset to have.
Why those feminists are upset and angry?
Viviane Linden Yeah. We still have our battles but we have also created some of the same problems women once had for the men that live now.
GhiraLink first wave feminism started at around the late 1800’s. Erin Pizzey wasn’t even born yet and the goal was to get women the right to vote.
Remi the only problem is when women try to support a lot of these movements (I could be stumbling upon the wrong ones lol) they are unwelcome. “You know nothing about our struggles”
"That would be terrible, as feminist I don’t want to see a man teaching a woman about feminism even if i totally disagree with her"
 @user-ei7ed6zy9k  so now respecting women makes you a SiMp?
"mona grimm 
There is a difference between fighting for equal rights and ""fighting for equal rights"". Many feminists completely disregard the other side, and same with men's rights activists. Neither side is actually fighting for equal rights."
Big Daddy Toyota Corolla Do you have female friends?
mona grimm Both movements are about equal rights tho....
 @user-ei7ed6zy9k  Why is it that a male feminist is a simp but a female male rights activist is not when they're both doing the same thing?
 @monagrimm1696  i agree now i am a man i agree that women deserve equal rights but now some feminists are getting to the point where they can play the victim card and get away with or get more then men can. But i do agree that women should be able to vote and get equal paying jobs and more
I'm a female male rights person. Also who the hell let Derrick the incel here? He does not belong anywhere in those two groups
*Men's Rights activist
That's weird
 @ihunoble4878  it is. The men's rights people who were pro-feminism branched off a while ago.
 @firesong7825  That's not even true. Feminists have been talking about how things like patriarchy and toxic masculinity have been hurting men for quite some time now.
 @user-ei7ed6zy9k  lol what
Big Daddy Toyota Corolla I don’t think you know what the meaning of SIMP is. People have made it to where simply complimenting a women or being un-conditionally nice to a women is being a SIMP that only looks for attention. No being a blatant needy male seeking the attention of women by being “abusive” and “ awkward” about it is Simping. So when you make a comment like this make sure you know what you are talking about.
Big Daddy Toyota Corolla you obviously don’t know what a simp is
"mona grimm 
I don’t think we want to label you as one of us females"
They should've had me there!
Oh I see you are interested only in the exceptionally rare
"ppl who might dont know, there are female male rights activist they are called honey  badger, also apart from this name there are women who truly support men what are suffer from"
I’m a male rights activist. I would have wanted to be on here for sure.
I thought derrick was a male on the thumbnail..
"🤦🏾‍♀️

how many people are gonna make this same comment?

like, damn."
"Yeah, that's not gonna happen. At least not that much anyway."
Kevin hart there you go
" @monagrimm1696    Honestly to me, Male rights activism seems more like just having equal rights as any person should have. Just like how feminism was before it started becoming way too toxic"
 @sheshenq  The wage gap absolutely was debunked. So many times that it's impossible to use it in an argument and not sound anecdotal.
 @loretofernandez2844  Can someone who has no lived experience as a veteran join a veteran support group?
 @RonaldChristy  Why couldn't men possibly understand the issues women face? Like... we have empathy. We're supposed to be able to do that.
i dont think there is any female mens rifht active
" @monagrimm1696  you’re an educated 


As a women 
I always see that when women hating a men 
Society called them as a independent strong 

When men hating on girls society called them as misogynist 

And what’s wrong with women that’s men’s activists 
When it’s okay for being male feminists

It like that you said that ""why would you as woman would want to lower yourself and under men’s"
"The former is easy to find, the latter, not so much"
"There are actually, but they are very few"
I wanna see only those two people have a debate tbh
" @firesong7825  i would say youre slightly incorrect and correct. Feminism doesn’t focus on JUST female rights, just mostly. The reason for that is bcs its women who have been the more opressed here. Feminism is about equal rights, no matter gender."
 @user-qb4ke6gm5b  could i ask why? like why mens rights instead of feminism
Mona grimm2 your not under freaking kind control get a grip
U can't even spell women without without men f feminist
 @alexmonterolopez5693  ?
 @yes-qt5nw  what is the truth women privilege literally is real
 @alexmonterolopez5693  for some things but this world has still been affected by patriarchy hugely
A meninist
Yeah there’s a “mens rights activist” woman on tik tok who lives where they film jubilee and I honestly think it would’ve been great to ask her. There’s also plenty of male feminists. It was probably just who was available or willing to participate
 @sheshenq the wage gap has nothing to do with gender lmao.
" @stinkoshatter-shield2096 that’s not true, just pearly things,taytaybee, femsapian just to name a few anti feminist women that are respected and loved by men."
I have seen many male feminists but never ever a female MRA (no offense but it is really true)
The two most annoying types of people lol
 @monagrimm1696  are you joking
" @therose1277  same, im a female but i also consider myself an anti-feminist!"
maybe they couldnt find one
Yeah they should’ve tried to find a male feminist and a female men’s rights activist
Agreed. Karen Straughan would have been a good choice.
"Honestly I wish I was on this, they should have another group for equalists, not more rights for women, not more rights for men, the same for both"
They would only find not like other girls
My aunt’s cat would’ve made this better then Derek.
" @croft4746  Yeah that's feminism. Feminism campaigns for equal rights. It's called the women's rights movement because they are the historically oppressed group much like blacks in the blacks rights movement. It's that group seeking more rights to be of equal standing, not having more rights than the other."
Anthony Leith women and men in today’s society have equal rights. This third wave feminism is not equal rights they want more rights then men. An example of this is when a male rape victim had to pay child support. He was raped she got pregnant and then he had to pay child support.
Pottehs ok but they could’ve found someone better than Derrick
Cratives Den so women aren’t allowed to have a different opinion than you or they’re trying to get accepted?
The feminists would’ve just called her a pick me because they can’t handle women having differing opinions than them
My cat butters My nuggets but that’s what feminism is
 @thatskai3070  wrong not all women who are MRA are pick me and you feminists are starting to throw that name around very loosely.
Sameee
Same
Same
Why would it piss you off?
" @kpopmarshmallow2112  I mean just from the title though, maybe they're all incels but men's rights activism in itself isnt bad. That doesnt mean that you're necessarily putting down women's issues."
 @LucielEllis  men' s rights activists aren't real. They're just mocking feminists
" @kpopmarshmallow2112  No it's real, men have many, many issues & its quite entitled of you to think that a movement for men is a direct attack on feminism & women."
" @azzytype  if it's about gay,trans or black men than yes. But these men in this video clearly aren't real activists bcs they never had good arguments about why they're men activists. They only wanted to mock the feminists."
 @kpopmarshmallow2112  you know that men die far younger than women? Or that the suicide rate of men is far higher than of women?
 @throwawayacc2618  so it's automatically because of women?
" @kpopmarshmallow2112  I can understand if you're talking abt Derrick, he was a jackass, but Zach and the other guy brought up discrimination such as custody, severity of jail sentences, and just the overall idea that men are generalized to harrass and take advantage of women."
 @throwawayacc2618  What has that to do with women? Likes yes my grandmas lived longer than my grandpas but that's not bcs of men's rights or whatsoever
" @kpopmarshmallow2112  I don't see why you needed to bring race, or sexuality into this.  & they did have good arguments such as the injustice in the court systems & such. I""m sure they could talk about much more issues as could the feminists, but the video can only be so long."
 @kpopmarshmallow2112   excuse me why are you putting them down? and mens right movement is a real thing thats not true at all how are they mocking? thats only derrick himself.
 @kpopmarshmallow2112  women do that too and they do things to against men and its not ALWAYS
Derrick enters the chat
yeah brother same here lols
LMAO FRR
Saaammmee
 @kpopmarshmallow2112  are you alright my friend?
YESSSS😭😂
"Although I disagree with most of the things Derrick says, That is scientifically true. Men are biologically stronger than woman, and woman are biologically more flexible."
They are but a women can become as strong as an average man (or stronger) and the same thing for a man to a women.
" @YT-fr5lf  I know that, but you get my point"
LMFAO A WALKING MEATBALL IM DECEASED
" Candra Nugraha  I completely agree, and I have seen in a lot of these types of clips or videos that one side or the other will speak with feeling and not facts"
 @YT-fr5lf  Like im a man. But i would never go against a female mma fighter. She will fold me in an instant.
 @YT-fr5lf  it depends if he/she does gym and eats properly or not
" @feardeath523  yeah exactly, like for either one you’d have to work really hard. I say that as a girl."
lmao!!
LMAOO
 @YT-fr5lf  still a fact that man are biologically stronger then woman doesn’t matter how hard they work there’ll always be a man stronger then you wich is why when it comes to all professional sports man are woman are separated
" @oniiiiiiiina4677  well actually, women CAN become as strong as men. Men can become as flexible as women. That’s also a fact."
DID YOU SAY MEATBALL LOLLLLLL
 @YT-fr5lf  именно
 Luís Andrade  yeah that I agree on
" @paccie9689  Derrick is not one of those men tho. He isn’t build to be strong, he is very physically out of shape and unhealthy.  Certain men are, but no,  not Derrick lmao"
😐
I feel bad for the kid that has to recreate the “ your my dad” vine with Derrick 😂
Hey some chose to be celibate as women are not his ultimate persuit.
"The first time i seen him i thought ""he has never touched a women before.."""
I dont wont to get rid of the 666
this man derrick is talking to the women like children smh
Bea the best. Equality but accepting that we are different creatures.
When he say healty male space why did the woman say it did not exsist and say they are toxic???????
Derek looks like he has Cheetos dust all over his computer's keyboard in his mom's basement
i wish they had male feminists and female men's rights believers
"The men were frustrating me, specifically Derrick"
"Mimi seems like the female Derrick, to me"
This video was important because it united men and women together so we can all hate Derrick.
"i just love how everybody it's just talking about how ignorant is derrick


i just love it"
Three years later and Dereck starting to look more insightful by the years. 😂😂😂
"People picking on Derrick and okay, fair I get that. But please have the same energy for when Aleysha become a joke police or when the girl is cutting off Kursat just dismissing his stat and facts."
The moment of disgusted SHOCK when Derreck said that WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE OLD WAYS WTF dude
"Yo who invited dude in the yellow jacket, bros mad cringe we don't claim him as the male species 🤦💀"
People like Derrick are the ones that snap one day and go on a rampage. Dude needs help.
Without even watching the video I saw comments about Derrick…before the introductions I knew which one was Derrick 😂😂😂
Did y’all just throw Derrick on the men’s rights side to sabotage their debate?
"I genuinely don't understand why Derrick wants a patriarchal world. He won't be considered as a 'real man' in that world, and those 'real man' could just bully him and won't be condemned."
Derrick no
5 rational people debate with Derrick 😂 💀💀
"me: trying to find a political fight in the comment section

comments: derrick sucks"
I’m sure his brain just can’t do better lol
 Blackpilled Saint  can you explain to me how women are children? you are going to treat a grown woman the same as a child? are you going to treat a grown woman the same as a male child? please explain.
Derrick is op
Cause they act like children tf
Blackpilled Saint Your prob a child too
 @koda3921  i assume you relate to them well then
Derrick is that homie with an extra chromie
Even though he's the real child.
" Blackpilled Saint  Ha, ha jokes. You're joking.....right?"
Because there acting like it honestly I found it funny 😂
That's just how he talks 😂😂😂
Blackpilled Saint preach
moose so women aren’t emontional like children
Good!!
Blackpilled Saint You talk too much and know too little.
I COMMENTED THIS TOO BEFORE I SAW YOUR COMMENT 😭😭😭
That sounds disgusting yet accurate
We have the same pfp
 @wegy2066  what da dog doin 😳
😭😭✋✋
"😂😂😂😂😂
Yall keep roasting the dude lol"
"or at least one woman and one man on the opposite side, but that's a brilliant idea."
rayan well they couldn't find those. Also a man and a female had mor elf a chance to go with their genders side
i was also hoping for that
Indeed. I think that would be a VERY interesting conversation
" @uri_9158.  True, but I know plenty of women (even in the their age range aka younger generation/millennials) that support men's rights or at the very least support a traditional relationship between those specific genders. I can't image it would be extremely challenging to find women to support that viewpoint unless they are located in a very liberal area and even then, once visit towns a little ways out, your chances increase. Same with male feminists, although I can agree with some that they are more in ""supply"" then female men's rights believers."
"@Furor Teutonicus I mean, the statement had to deal with the existence of male or female counterparts of either issue. But, while I get your point on who is allowed to speak on feminism, since this video asks for the opinions of both sides, to have an honest debate all viewpoints are needed right? 


It wouldn't just be an all male feminist group but many two of each on each side, ya know? After all, the goal of discussion is to find some kind of consensus to work on, not to exclude those that may agree with you because you dislike their position."
Watch ShoeOnHead
"I mean aren't all feminists mens rights believers?? They're advocating equality, which includes men into the equation"
"I was hoping for a mix on each side.  It's too easy to look at this and see ""Men vs Women"""
@Furor Teutonicus that's sexist lol
"@Furor Teutonicus that's not the truth at all, or at least not what i think. Of course that i want a male feminist to speak on my behalf, what i don't accept is that a man has to say the exact same thing that i am saying in orther to be heard, believed and taken in consideration."
@Furor Teutonicus I disagree
I am a femal men’s rights believer but I do not fully agree with these men
"@Furor Teutonicus Umm no. There has been an episode on Jubilee a while back on the topic of feminism and there was a male feminist on the panel and the female feminists treated him with utmost respect. It was amazing and definetely not unsurprising. 

Why would you hate on someone who believes in exactly what you believe in and helps you get it across, into motion, popular etc.?

This is a generalization I can't even understand how it even formed in your head. It makes no sense for anybody to be like that."
"rayan Yeah, Karen Straughn is one of the best."
I'd like to see a white BLM activist again a black Trump supporter
Yeah that would have been a  cool conversation
there is
Gavvy yes we do.
"That’s true, but it wouldn’t be the same because the male feminists haven’t experienced the discrimination that women have. I’m sure it would also be very hard to find a female male rights believer."
Maleist
YES YES YES YES
"@Furor Teutonicus As a male feminist, I'm more usually dismissed by the opposition calling me a white knight. I don't recall ever being shut down by a female feminist"
"men’s rights as a campaign literally started out as a joke and way to smear campaign against feminism. the entire problem with “men’s rights” activists is that they don’t care about facing up to the way male privilege and patriarchy both benefit and harm men - they only care about (cis) men’s pain INSTEAD of (cis) women’s pain. they’re reactionary, and the “movement” - if u can even call it that - is focused on comparing struggles, rather than approaching them in an intersectional, open minded way"
Great idea but that would show how rediculous all this is
"I've seen plenty of male feminists (Justin Trudeau), and some of them are even more radical than the female versions themselves."
" @LiliumPetal  I have not once seen a modern feminist bring up that males are the overwhelmingly majority victims of workplace deaths, violent assaults, murder, war casualties, suicide, etc. on their own volition. Almost all of them have rather brushed it off, responded by blaming it all on men, or denied it altogether."
 @ghostofgarycoleman5251  how would you have liked them to respond? genuine curiosity bc Idek what I'd say to that
" @savethebees2126  Maybe acknowledge that they are real pertinent issues and are not only being addressed ""as a response to feminism to attack women and feminism."" I've seen many feminists give that type of response during my time here on Youtube and other social media. It sounds a lot like this... 9:18"
" @savethebees2126  That's assuming they even want ""equality"" in the true sense to begin with. You can't have equality if you're constantly advocating in favor of one direction and completely ignoring the entire other side of the equation. If feminists really wanted equality, they should call themselves egalitarians and start addressing disparities on both sides."
"@Furor Teutonicus Feminism is a very diverse and spanning topic. There is no such thing as outliers because it is so big and the perspective you view it  from influences exactly what you consider as ""outliers"". 

I specified exactly the context of when the generalized image of female feminists treating male feminists is laughably wrong. 

'In general' is subjective. In general where? When? In what division? It all depends on specifics.
Besides, the ""general"" attitude doesn't represent all of feminism either."
Agreed
FACTS
But then out would be less dramatic🙄
" @LiliumPetal  feminism use to be about fighting for equality but now it's a fight for superiority. My question why is ""Equality"" always refered to as ""Feminism""? I know why their not fighting for equality anymore."
" @sunniduran5144  Because ""egalitarian equilibrium movement"" just doesn't roll off the tongue quite as nicely. That and the movement has focused on the inequality of women in comparison to men, especially in the time when the movement first started."
" @mbfv6773  Being a feminist is not ""being a woman"". It's supporting women's rights to equal treatment. Men can absolutely be feminists."
" @ghostofgarycoleman5251  Well that's because the movement is centered around women's rights and the inequalities centered around their position in society today. However, while they aren't points that are brought up by the movement, support and concern over these topics is absolutely something any feminist should have. Men's rights is a different movement, hence the debate here. What I'm saying is we need to stop bickering about who's more oppressed and work and support eachother to achieve a world more focused on human rights in general and I don't see that from most MRAs I come across.


EDIT: Also, in regards to your point about the MR movement being ""in response to feminism"". That literally is the case though. The concerns that have come up from it are legitimate and we need to address them, but throughout history the movement has been used in an overwhelmingly negative way to impede the progress being advocated for by women. The movement was formed in the 70's when the feminist movement began challenging the traditional gender roles of the time and were key players in the attack and mischaracterization of the ERA, and propagating the popular conservative opinion that feminists are ""crazy"" as pushed by Phyllis Schaflay"
" @sunniduran5144  There's nothing inherently wrong with the 3rd wave, and it is a necessary addition to the progress of women's rights. We still are not legally equal in the law especially in regards to reproductive rights, we still have a problem with a pay-gap in many industries, and we still objectified as sexual objects in many ways by the media and society.
I've never liked the ""wave"" terminology because it discredits the progress that takes place in between the main pushes of the movement, but the 3rd wave is advocating for many of the same equalities and rights as the other 2 have honestly, they're just doing it in their own way, as every other wave has done before them. 
I think what you're implying by the 3rd wave, and correct me if I'm wrong, is the more extremist feminists that attack other sects of the feminist movement rather than focusing on progressing women's rights, and that I would agree with you with. But like many others in this comment section, you're talking about a small but vocal minority with this complaint and using it to paint the 3rd wave with a single broad stroke when the vast majority of 3rd wave feminism is built on the same foundations as the rest of the movement."
This is such a cool idea!
"rayan 

The only time I’d be rooting for the women!"
" @ghostofgarycoleman5251  I agree with you. Feminism is not the movement to talk about men's rights though. If the movement were to shift focus to include everyone's rights then it would be less effective like if you were to round the tip of a spear. If you round it too much then itll be ineffective at its job. Mens rights needs their own movement to push the inequalities they face and the two movements need to work together with each other to push for the rights of everyone. The only reason I bring up the responsorial history of the MRM is that I dont believe it to be an effective movement to advocate for men's rights. It's become so politically charged and they focus far too much on what feminism is doing rather than what needs to be done to actually address the issues at hand. Like you yourself are saying, ""feminists aren't talking about our rights and struggles"" well that's because the MRM is supposed to be the ones pushing for those things. Feminism is about equality as it pertains to the oppressions WOMEN face, the MRM should be the same for men, but instead all I ever see from the movement and its supporters is about what women are doing and not anything meaningful about pursuing men's rights"
 @harmonya-e5341  No. It's much easier to find a male feminist than it is to find a female MRA. MRAs are shamed for even existing. Just imagine finding a woman on their side. Even tradcon women are usually anti-MRA.
" @taliab.7329  Lol, 
It's always hilarious when a feminists get mra's confused with ""meninists.""  Meninists are the joke campaigners, not mra's.  At least know the difference before starting to spout off."
" @LiliumPetal  
""The only reason I bring up the responsorial history of the MRM is that I dont believe it to be an effective movement to advocate for men's rights. It's become so politically charged and they focus far too much on what feminism is doing rather than what needs to be done to actually address the issues at hand.""


Talk about a pot calling a kettle black.


Every movement is a ""response"" to something:  Feminism vs. Patriarchy, BLM vs. police brutality & racism, LGBT rights vs. any religious institution; not sure why MRA's should be singled out.  The belief that the feminist movement has gotten everything right (ESPECIALLY in regards to men) and cannot be questioned. 
Feminist influences can be found in education (in all levels), private organizations, media, the law (look up the American Bar Association trying to incorporate affirmative consent laws), politics, hollywood, and any NGO; but mra's are getting ""so political.""  Are you kidding, really?!!!  


C'mon Lilium, there's a lot of privilege you're expressing here."
" @taurusteelpan  ""every movement is a 'response' to something"" - yes but my statement regarding the MRM is that it was an in many ways still is a response to another movement in an attempt to impede said movement's progress. BLM has ALM/BlueLM, Feminism has MRM, the ERA had Phyllis Schlaflay and ""STOP ERA"". These movements are not responses to injustices or inequality, nor are they seeking to remedy any inequalities; they don't stand FOR anything, rather their entire existence was formed to stand AGAINST another movement. This is illustrated mostly in their names, Black Lives Matter becomes All Lives Matter to directly contradict the movement being discredited, and so on. That is my point with the MRM, although I will say that I think the movement has come a long way from its beginnings as simply responsorial. I just think women need to become less of a target with less statements like ""women aren't talking about this"" and more about speaking up for things itself. Like the disparity of suicide and mental health inequality in America. Why don't we stop saying ""you think women have it rough, how about this statistic-"" and more about actually getting men the health care they need?


As I said, I think most all the concerns they speak on are relevant and need to be addressed, but the way they frame these issues is overwhelmingly done in a way, again like we're seeing so much of in the comments here, that says, ""feminists say that they're oppressed, but WE'RE really the oppressed ones"" in an attempt to discredit the feminist movement instead of shine light to the inequalities that they're facing. 


Why do we have to say that women aren't truly oppressed simply because men are also oppressed? It solves nothing and only pits the two groups against one another rather than pushing human rights forward as a whole. It makes it a competition, not a movement. My opinion as to the difference between this and what the feminist movement is the feminist movement was formed to further the rights of women, not to discredit men's rights or impede on their rights, but to seek that they are alotted the same rights as men are regardless of sex, unless we're talking about radical feminists, but they're honestly kind of too aggressive imo so I can see where you're coming from there. That's why I don't believe it to be a kettle-pot scenario.


You do have a lot of good points though, and like I've said, I'm in no way against the advocacy of men's rights. Equality is equal to me, and everyone deserves to be given equal rights and protections. I just think it's being gone about in the wrong way regarding the MRM as well as with other movements like radical feminism or BlueLM; they have some legitimate concerns, but their method of communicating those concerns is in many cases harmful and works to hurt impede the rights being fought for by others."
" @LiliumPetal  Have you even seen the documentary""Red Pilled""? It's very good, it was directed and produced by a once upon time feminist. Do give it a chance and you will know how some women abuse our rights to do men wrong."
" @sunniduran5144  I have seen the film, and I agreed with some portions, less so with others. Most of the points regarding actual men's rights were the most compelling, while the rest felt like it was kinda meandering to me. The moderate channel Knowing Better has a video about the film on his channel that I'd recommend"
 @LiliumPetal  I can tell that you believe and stand for true equality. I like we've been able to have an adult conversation about this even when we've disagreed. I wish every conversation could be like this. ☺
" @sunniduran5144  Thank you, I appreciate that, especially coming from someone who's opinions don't exactly align with mine. This has been a nice conversation despite our differences, and I'm glad we've ended on such a positive note. 


I don't know why we've all become so spiteful towards one in recent years. It only separates us further and causes extremism. I think ultimately we all need to realize that we're not against eachother in this, but I'm not sure if that'll ever happen with the way things are right now."
" @LiliumPetal  Here's hope for the future, my friend."
rayan i just spent a full minute trying to read the work “believers”
Leave it to women to be frustrated over a youtube video 🤘
 @The.rapist911  Leave it to men to be obnoxious
 @anunwantedsoul3672  leave it to the genders fighting each other because they can't agree
Lmao no?
YES im a boy and I hated everything Derrick said I believe in gender equality.
" Angry Egalitarian  Mimi and Alyesha were as bad if not worse than Derrick, but they are both reasonably attractive and don't get the hate. It's interesting we talk about ""toxic masculinity"" but it ain't masculinity that is actively bullying a dude for being ugly."
i know right
"Everybody loves to be agreed with, nothing special about you."
No one asked tho
"The problem with the incel community is that there are varied subsections of groups which differ in intensity, and there is not an official treatise of what exactly constitutes the incel philosophy (blackpill).  Their general argument, which is that women are more selective than men for relationships, is a slippery contention because there is minimal evidence for it.  However, they capitalize on events where women carry a certain attitude towards men solely on their appearance, although this is not to say all women behave this way.  What one could surely say is that there has been a major culture change on the viewing towards polygamist sex, when throughout most of modern history, fornication was frowned upon.  Media categorizes relationships to almost be considered as a fashion statement, where strapping, tall muscular men bond with lustrous, curvaceous women.  These unrealistic physical archetypes of what men and women should be leave an entire population subconsciously influenced by such standards.  People become more jealous of sex when all forms of media glorify it to be an amazing thing.  Underrepresented Men in the dating scene, who probably do not meet this media standard of tall and muscular, probably have a much harder time to attract women because psychologically they feel physically inadequate due to cultural standards, leading them to a downward spiral of resentment and low self-esteem.  Some women who are more in preference to physical intimacy than long-term authentic relations, may hanker more towards better-looking men because it makes them feel subconsciously to be of better value.  What makes this premise interesting is that men’s supposed physical standards are more of a congenital nature while women’s are not.  For example, an overweight woman would not be considered attractive by many but such physical drawbacks can most likely be prevented.  On the other hand, a genetically short male cannot change his height, or modify a physically unattractive face because men are not expected to wear make up.  Derrick employs the faulty generalization fallacy when he says that most women are naturally superficial towards looks, but it is by nature that humans tend to trust more better attractive people than less attractive ones.  This may not detract a psychologically sound, although physically ungifted male from wooing females, though it may make things more difficult in a society where we create matches at the click of a button through dating apps.  Men should be more grateful of where their physical gifts lie and not expect to bond with a “movie-quality” female, but women should be more understanding of men who may have below-average looks.  All of this finger-pointing is useless when it comes to reducing the physical prejudices we have in society.  The toxic side of the incel community recognizes some social pitfalls, but quickly generalizes the motives of women.  The hyper sexualization of media and the false advertising of romance, as well as drunken mayhem and party scenes of 20-something year olds, where the most visceral and attractive partygoers have casual sex every weekend and treat it like the time of their life, leaves physically ungifted men infuriated, when their testosterone levels are raging high and their fathers and grandfathers would have already been married.  This is not to say that this culture is necessarily wrong, but we must encourage people to change their outlook of what creates an ideal, physically attractive  man and woman."
 @arkantos2227  where did they said they are special lmao. it is just random statement
Well he is a self proclaimed and proud incel. That sort of toxic mentality is expected from his kind.
Ikr like of course he wants to go back to the old days cause men could control women all they want and the women couldn't do much abt it
 @kingace6186  wild west days I guess but I don't think he'd survive
 @kingace6186  Derrick's description of his ideal societal order sounded like the US in the 1950's.
"I believe by the old way he meant when dating wasn't as complicated, when rights weren't in a fritz that come and go and change for and against people, and a time where there wasn't a civil sex war."
 @arthurswanson1755  yup lmfao
I would have lost it right then and there. Though I’m curious how ‘old’ he means. I’d like to go back to the Viking age where women could dismember their abusers in the middle of town.
 @baileymoran8585  ikr
"because the ""old ways"" is the only way for him to even have a chance to get with a woman"
"Fr “the old days” have never been good, ppl didn’t have rights. And no one was happy except cis, white, Herero, rich, able, men."
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO
My guy is doing your job bro
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THUMBS UPPP DUDEEEEEE 🤣❤️
He's immature lmao
Betrix why do you think?
"Thirst_xgood that’s an interesting point of view, care to elaborate?"
@xxhaliamariexx most likely
thats discrimination at its best
Thats the opinion some men share. Its called Liberal Democracy.
Couldve thrown in a radical on both sides to spice it up
Seems so lol Like I know he's an incel but I don't think Incels call themselves MRAs nor partake in their movement so it was odd of him to be in the debate.
 @KaiDecadence  whats the difference
"To be fair the other two guys were pretty tame. As a feminist, I would be casual friends with the other two. I think their opinions are fair, just different from mine. Kinda balances it out, I think they were just mislead into believing that feminists are more radical than they actually are, and felt the need to retaliate."
 @KaiDecadence  can you not be both tho
 @moon-pw1bi  You can but it's just the usual Incel isn't.
 @KaiDecadence  What I don't get is hos is this guy an incel? I've seen much less attractive/articulate or whatever people easily get dates. How did he fall into that sort of mentality? It's sad.
 @Defiring  Who knows really but I know that part of inceldom is the self-defeated mindset.
"The only reason he's even there is to give feminists a way to use the ""strawman argument"""
" @calthekonqueror312  Pretty much. I still can't get who had the great idea of inviting an incel like him to such a discussion. It only handicapped the men's side of the debate, making them look worse. Ayesha, on the other hand, at least looks a bit more sympathetic even despite me not agreeing with her points."
I know he looks like your standard capital g gamer and yes i play video games but i dont identify as a gamer.
He was an absolute child.
" @Plaky  He does not even remotely represent anyone I ever met in person, guess I'm lucky. He is definitely an incel but that does not represent mra. They fight against ""injustices"" against men. Feminists fight against ""injustices"" against women. I try to look at things fairly and call out bias when I see it either way. In this case I feel that Derrick is a misrepresentation of their movement meant to make them look bad."
so more of the same....
" @Plaky  ""and derek gives an accurate image of an incel/mra."" That was what it sounded like to me but whatever."
That's exactly what I was thinking
" @calthekonqueror312  damn, this was beautifully worded, well said"
That’s the best part. Most of these incels would be bullied
It would suckk
Because in that society it reduces the instances of incels due to 2 parent households
"THIS! But, let me tell u, maybe more types of Derricks will see this and invalidate u"
"With Derrick’s height and appearance, in and out, he’d definitely be bullied in a patriarchal society. The real one."
"With Derrick’s height and appearance, in and out, he’d definitely be bullied in a patriarchal society. The real one."
The world shows no sympathy for men like derrick... he truly lost at birth
Word! I came here for a debate but all I see is hate for Derek but I'm not mad 🤣
"Ikr? Was no one talking about how alyesha was so defensive and she  wanted stories to be told for a argument, what about mimi when she said ""I didn't come with a list dude"" when kursat wanted some evidence. Overall mimi alyesha and derrick were the rotten fruits in the basket."
He does though
@Onnolee Slaten so u here rn?
 @acar8791  nah just Derrick
Love how Jubilee drops the studies as they speak😂
Hot take: feminism and men’s rights are two sides of the same coin.
there’s a reason why women don’t talk to derrick bro 💀💀💀💀
Anti-Women activists vs feminists vs Derrick and Zach.
"The men offer comparisons and middle ground, the women play victims and say stop attacking me. All that we need to know."
"This makes you feel very sad for Derrick😢 He will live alone and a virgin believing women are responsible for his happiness and being resentful, hoping women who don’t even know or care that he exists feel punished."
All these feminists mad at Derrick but he not wrong
"MRA
Zach tried very hard to listen and was respectful but stuck to his values
Kursat was very logical and precise with his points
Feminists
Mimi was belittling when confronted and felt a little hand holdy and finger wagging when they talked about men (My opinion)
Bea was great and understanding but stuck to their values
Aleysha was kinda and understanding at points but got emotional and seems to have a lot of unresolved trauma which affected the debate
 
And Derrick was Derrick"
Where is Andrew Tate when we need him
"If u need me not to hurt you, that means inherently you can't protect yourself"
Derrickification is the reason why a child needs both parents.
"“Incel activist” 



This will be an interesting one"
"Before this video I m not decided because sometime feminism kind a go towards men hating, but what they represent is real feminism, which I agree with."
Everyone calling out Derrick when Mimi was by far the least intelligent and most uninformed participant
"Derrick: opens mouth

Me: say sike right now"
"the world took simple biological differences and created a war. nature gave us diversity, and we made things complex asf"
I love how every content is about Derrick lol
"Derrick: „I‘m part of the INCEL-group“ 

No woman wants to have sex with you? Really?? Who would believe that?!"
"I like Zach he was genuinely trying to like understand the other side and asked questions while still expressing his side respectfully. I absolutely cannot stand Derek wtf is he talking about I think that he needs therapy tbh, the fact that he said men shouldn’t show their emotions with woman. How do you deepen relationships with them like- . Also idk why he seems homophobic to me and if he doesn’t like woman so much why doesn’t he go date a man? like I need him to really just take some self reflection and everyone who genuinely agrees with him too."
Derrick’s fighting for boy’s rights 🥱
Yes
P I C K L E D— S A R D I N E S understandable
Who is this derrick guy?
e13kid the guy in the yellow jacket
"on GOD, so much cringe"
"1:53, did he just call himself... an.... incel?"
"I would, seeing how he acts"
 @pikpikkeripik7952   they're being sarcastic...
"I’m SHOCKED.  SHOCKED, I tell you!"
"I disagree with the feminist and I'm female. Basically, they just want to end the perspective of men towards women but they're doing the exact same to them. I have experienced harassment, but that doesn't mean even guy is bad or toxic 😂😂... You just need to learn to respect yourself, something that most of these women don't do. Women do have more rights than men in this time, in this era. Why? Because if you go to court, just because you're female and to not be discriminated... You will basically win.. also, women are needed for children.. i was raised by my mother, I had no father in my life, and I still disagree with feminists because of everything I've seen. I also disagree with Derrick in a few things. You don't need to get married to have a happy life. You can be alone if you want to. Both of their perspectives are just horrible.. those aren't human rights if you're just criticizing one another just for not seeing your point of view 😂😂😂"
I agree
i think zach has a youtube channel- zach hing. hes rlly respectful about it all too.
I think derek gets rejected by woman so many times because he looks like a crushed pineapple and now he hates woman.
And kursat is the intelligent guy that no one understands
Aintfor33 damn he’s still hurt from the girl that cheated on him in middle school😔🤚🏻
"Me: oh let’s look in the comment section to see what people are discussing

Comment section: Derrick"
the fact that i can’t interfere this argument to scream at derrick is honestly very nerve wrecking
"Derrick: Hey I’m Derrick and I’m a YouTube

Everyone else: disappointment increases"
Let's go Derick🤧
We can never be the same
"Kursat about to ask a good question:



Derrick: WOmeN ARe ChILDreN"
"I read the comments, literally less than four seconds after Derrick started talking, I had to change the video"
"Debate Ranking
1. Bea
2. Zach
3. Ashley
4. Kursat
5. Mimi
6. Derrick"
"What this comment section should be: A debate
What this comment section is: Bagging Derrick"
YOU NEED REAL MEN IN THIS DEBATE THIS IS A JOKE BUT I LOVE THE SHOW!!!
"no one: 
derrick: let’s go back to the 19th century where women had no rights and i could go to church"
These poor men are so delusional.
I love how at the end the guys give several compliments and the girls didn’t give a single one
Someone who stands for men’s rights really said men shouldn’t show there emotions
The guy in the yellow shirt grosses me out... He is not only arrogant but completely blind
Derrick: Lets go back to the past and be in a patriarchy because then a woman will be forced to marry me and I wont have to live in my mom's basement eating chips and playing fortnite..
"Why the world is bad:
Coronavirus
Wildfires
Holocaust
Derrick"
Start a war in my replies. I think this was very unfair. They didnt put competent people on the stage. So i would like to pose the same questions and ask everyone to debate them here.
I changed my comment so no one knows what I said >:D
"Derrick: exist
Everyone: hold up"
Nothing else... I mean if no one else is gonna appreciate Derrick can we atleast appreciate Zach and Bea (kinda)
Derrick looks like he smells like hair grease and ketchup
" @kylie2cool271  
feminists: ""we don't judge people by looks""
Also feminists: ""hA He LooKs aNd smElls likE greAse"""
 @blueberry5996  lmfao
"Dude, I think EVERYONE is saying Derrick smells. Not just Feminists. Lol"
Bea is the best!
Ikr lol
D E R R I C K
You shouldn’t be apart of the discussion if you’re gonna scream at someone lol
Raspy it’s a joke ma’am
" @checkmqtes180  Oh, then I had a lot of fun laughing at the funny joke."
jaeminned not funny
" @checkmqtes180  gr8 joke m8, 88/8"
jaeminned some of derricks claims were right though like men and women are totally different and we were made to do certain things
Jay Essex yes but he is sexist he said I don’t think you can be friends with a woman
does anybody know what his youtube channel is
"Being a youtuber doesn't instantly invalidate someone, there are plenty of sensible people making a living off of youtube.

Derrick though...

He isn't one of those people."
Bryce Rothschadl u just ruined the joke
" @ghost_witdatoast28  
If stating a fact ruins the joke then maybe the joke was inaccurate and low quality to begin with?"
@Jeff B profile picture checks out.
Bryce Rothschadl saying that this has 900 likes I can’t say I agree
Kursat about to debunk wage gap - edited out 3:30
YOOO Kursat straight up looks like Linguini from Ratatouille... 😂
 @Revhead88  Wonder what else is missing?
 @godzilla2k26  About an hour and a half. Kursat posted a recording of the whole thing.
i would put kursat higher since he actually brought some evidence and was prepared. i would put bea down cause she seemed like she had specific instances that makes her deny other beliefs

Trevor Philips what does ER mean ?? English isn’t my first language
literally 🙏🙏
He got halfway to it by going to church yet he still have to travel back in time🤣
 @sanjita7232   We hope right?
He made me mad. I seriously would have slapped him
I have no respect for that guy
" John-Michael Delton White  honey, he disagrees with women's rights"
" John-Michael Delton White  ok babes, you give off misogynistic vibes"
and then he said he had empathy for the other side💀
That ending caught be off guard 😭 😭 🤣 🤣
And yet they still won the argument lol.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  Well, we disagree there."
"​ @kumaranvij , how? The vvomen had no real argument and were made to look silly at times.

Why shouldn't men have their issues addressed?"
 @DavidW-ng5zv  why isn't it toxic for MRA's to say masculinity means men are inherently lesser parents?
"​ @regisglass5464 Then why do vvomen make up the vast majority of those in care jobs? Do vvomen not give birth?

Why don't you answer my question and instead deflect? Why do vvomen make up the vast majority of those in care jobs?

Most men don't want to do care jobs or childcare."
 @funkylay6227  no when males have depression at a higher rate than women and have a higher suicide rate
soopa if we show any type of emotion then we are considered weak 🤦
" cartohead  I'm a feminist , and please believe me dude , feminism is not about mocking men . If anyone , man or woman , ever tries to degrade you or anyone on that matter for showing emotions in the name of feminism, just ignore them . They are not feminists , they are using feminism as an excuse to vent their own frustration ."
" cartohead  Also , fragile masculinity is a term used to describe men who think things like "" crying is feminine "" , "" dressing up in pink is less manly "" etc . This term is not for man who aren't afraid to show their emotions without being scared about becoming "" less of a man "" . I think you misunderstood that phrase."
BTS and TXTlover Stray Kidz Fans Are NICE period. it’s about equality.
Daniel no it’s about equality. not man-hating.
Daniel it’s about equality
"@Daniel It's not feminists being misandristic , it's minsandristics calling themselves feminists . I know there's no point in arguing with that type because they won't listen . They are basically female incels and just how I don't engage myself in an argument with incels , I won't engage myself in an argument with misandritics either . It's a wastage of time . Even a few years back , I tried to talk things out with the incel type ( both men and women , as you were telling me to do in the first place ) , and then gave up . It's easier to make a lizard understand quantum mechanics than to make an incel or misandrist understand the importance of patience and empathy . 🙄"
"@Daniel Let me ask you , have you ever tried to stop a man from hating on women ? Have you ever argued with an incel about women's rights ? 

I don't think so . And I don't expect that from you as well , because we all know that it's useless . I hope you understand it's the same for us , women . We , who want equality and want to put in effort to bring it ( not just run our mouths ) , like to stay away from the misandrists . Sadly , the misandrists are so vocal that they have come to become the representatives of feminism . 
And I understand men's frustration with this . If someone keeps on trying to label every man as "" an as*hole "" , "" a r*pist""  etc everywhere , then it's only natural that you'll become defensive . It's natural , to hate feminism because nobody wants to be labelled as something they are not . 
But at the same time , there are men who , just want to enjoy certain privileges just because they are men and they expect women to behave in a certain way . They also hate feminism , but for a different reason . They are so used to disrespecting women that they can't stand the thought of women being "" equals"" . 

If you hate feminism for the first reason , then I think I understand you . But you need to understand too that you are having to suffer the consequences of the second type . Because there are so many men out there who can't stand the idea of being equals , women get defensive too and that results is all the men being labelled as such ( just how you were doing it with feminists , so you can't blame anyone , can you ? ) .
I'm not supporting either of you , but there's a reason behind every action . So maybe if we , both men and women could spare some time to understand each other , we could've been in a much better state .😊"
"I don't think the ""letting men show emotion"" thing is really about that. i think this whole thing is an attempt to ""feminize"" men."
"@Daniel I never said they are not feminists, if they want to call themsleves feminists then they are feminists , but they are to feminism as incels are to men's right movement ......where's the difficulty in understanding that ? According to your logic , should I then generalize all men's right activists as incels ?"
"@Daniel There's no problem in calling them out , but labelling all feminists as "" men haters "" and feminism as man hating culture , isn't that circular thinking at it's worst as well ?"
" @woohooman-fl9vq  The problem is that you think crying makes a man feminine ! But is there any logic behind that ? Why would crying make a man "" feminine "" ?

I'm very proud and happy to say that the man I love is strong enough to show his emotions without worrying about if that makes him ""feminine"" or not . He has got that inner strength I can only dream to achieve and I've got immense respect for him . Showing emotion is not feminine , it's just a way of expressing yourself . Some people are introverts , like me , who can't show emotions in front of other  people . I haven't cried for years , let alone publicly , not even in privet, because that is just my type . Does that make me ""masculine man "" ? 🤣


( I'm a woman as you can already guess 😊)"
"@Daniel  I wasn't calling you an incel ! I was trying to say that just like all MRAs are not incels , all feminists are not misandristics ."
"@Daniel Liking or not liking feminism is up to you . I just wanted to show you that there's another side of feminism that you may not be familiar with . I'll again say feminism is not about hating men , so even if you don't like a side of feminism , maybe try not to be bitter about every feminist ? Bitterness doesn't help anyone 😊"
"@Daniel Actually I wasn't trying to make you feel disturbed, people thinking MRAs are incels would disturb me rather , just how people thinking Feminists are misandrists would disturb me . I was speaking from my perspective"
Right?! That was ridiculous. I think that being able to show their emotions actually would show that they are comfortable enough in their masculinity that it doesn’t bother them.
Right?! That was ridiculous. I think that being able to show their emotions actually would show that they are comfortable enough in their masculinity that it doesn’t bother them.
"@Daniel Feminism is not about hating men but okay , let's stop it now . We are getting nowhere and I'm wasting my time 😅"
@Daniel Really dude ? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
" cartohead  I wasn't offended in any way . Why would I be offended when you guys are talking about your problems which are just as real as our problems ? Maybe you misunderstood my intention . I was never defending this ""men hating "" culture either . Whenever I come across someone who dislikes feminism , the moment they learn I'm a feminist , they automatically assume that I'm an arrogant and stubborn person . Tell me , wouldn't you be hurt too if someone assumed such things just because you belong to a certain gender and support certain ideals ? That's why whenever I come across someone who dislikes feminism, I try to talk to them , mainly to find out what we can do to make this stigma about feminism go away 😊"
 cartohead  do you not get ✨ jokes ✨
"I kinda thought about the origin of the idea ""Men shouldn't easily show their emotions, esp crying"". Let's imagine a couple, man and woman, facing a tragedy which, let's say induce tears. When you're crying badly, you lose the ability to think calmly and logically because that's when emotion takes over logic. Imaginr if both are bawling their eyes out over the situation, who will take care of the matter? Passerby? No, one has to step up to take care of matters. So, no. It's not that men are not allowed to cry easily, but it's to build a stronger mental when facing problems. So men won't easily run away from problems. Why men? Because men were born with a body to build muscle easier. If women were born with that kind of body, they would be demanded with same idea (i think). Men are demanded to think and act more logically, because women are overflowed with progesterone. Like, feel free to cry to all your content AFTER you take care of your trouble. Which women are medically less likely to be able to in comparison to men. Of course, some women has more testosterone so they are more likely to be manlier and can handle things better than other women. Well, I hope I get my point through. 

With love, 
From a woman."
" @shikumohayashi6990  muscle has legit nothing to do with fixing your problems. Tell a guy child being abused by parents to solve their problems by... Violence? Come on... You're encouraging bad behaviour here, please..."
" cartohead  they should be jailed in my opinion if the story is true. I understand that rape of men is very real and people make fun of men for getting raped and don't believe ever. I understand it. It's a men's issue. It's important. But, BUT. Don't blame all feminists for this (you didn't really say it, but just to make sure). Also, yes you're pretty insecure when it comes to showing emotions to others."
" cartohead  yes I would. Actually, I am sceptical whenever this happens to anyone. For example, the situation that happened with bunch of streamers being accused of raping women. I didn't believe any of them right off the bat. Heck, I still don't cuz I have no clue if they're true or not. For all I know it could be people doing so to get attention. Showing emotions isn't as same as being there to comfort someone. Showing emotions is... Showing emotions to people, not comforting others when they're showing them (at least not in this context)."
 @luchastudios9414  right to domestic abuse shelters
 @luchastudios9414  right not to have to go into military by force
" @luchastudios9414  it's fine, but it also works for the other one. Women in many places around the world don't have even the right to vote which is insane. In the Muslim world they're forced to wear certain clothing and not be open. They're often not the person by whose name their bloodline is continued and in man places no right to abortion or inability to get certain birth control methods without husband's permission. These things work both ways. I think it's a societal problem but yea."
" cartohead  I'm not ignoring. I'm saying that for you to go deal with it in your room instead of with others is hiding emotions, so, not openly expressing them, and I think that's mostly due to insecurity. Then again you may have some family background that distances you from them, in that case I approve. I have seen your other comments too btw."
 cartohead  what? No? Nowhere did i say that what??
" cartohead  yea... That's has nothing to do with supporting your mum. Supporting her is the right thing to do, but expressing how you feel only when you get away from them is insecure. Two different things dude."
" @luchastudios9414  yea, agreed"
My_ Balls_Jangel Not everyone is the same in my eyes men that show they’re emotions are very strong anyone at that matter
"Hailey Marufu actions speak louder than words, it’s man hating. If ppl want it to be seen as equality then the good feminists should try to do something once in awhile instead of the bad ones rioting at men’s mental health meetings etc"
 @ohnoohno1299  nobody did anything for men yet ngl
"cartohead yooo dude those aren’t feminist, those are sexists. Please see the difference, they might call themselves feminists, nut they’re not. Seriously dude, as a feminist I think that ‘i drink male tears” is as sexist as “I drink female tears”. It’s better to just say ‘I drink sexist tears’ I think"
"My_ Balls_Jangel yeah, and it’s flicked up. As a feminist I think men have to show their emotions. It’s just our society thinks that emotions is a weak thing"
Daniel are you trying to stop anti-feminists? I don’t think so man
"1974woohooman you’re sarcastic, right?"
"*Woman falls and cries
Everyone: Omg are you ok??
*Man falls and cries
Everyone: Man up"
My_ Balls_Jangel but why does it have to be that way... like everyones feelings r valid
Daniel thats what u think. and because of comments like this it gives the wrong impression of feminism
1974woohooman but the problem is that men think showing emotion is feminine when really its being a human being
"Daniel im too lazy to type but feminism isnt man hating, its equity for everyone period"
cartohead I’m confused what that has to do with what I said
im fairly sure he can see actually
I would have to agree.
"this is a strictly NO FUN ZONE, no lighthearted jokes are allowed, only misery is allowed"

@Daniel bruh feminists aren't anti man
@Daniel bruh
@Daniel yeah by I am a feminist and fight for equality in example parental court issues towards men and r*pe culture so by hating on the movement you make more and more people don't want to fight for your and everyones right of equality.

"@Daniel You can't just ignore fact. You say you understand but you don't. Here, I've made it more readable, 
The official definition from wiki, it doesn't say ""hates men"" anywhere in here: 
Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define, establish, and achieve the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes.[Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male point of view, and that women are treated unjustly within those societies. Efforts to change that include fighting against gender stereotypes and establishing educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women that are equal to those for men."
 Sarah Bee  go off queen
@Daniel also the thing you're talking about is misandrists
@Daniel You still didn't answer the goddamn question
"@Daniel do you believe in equal rights for women, men, non binary ppl (etc) as well as the LGBT+, and every race?"
"@Daniel I wasn't asking you to reply with ""AKA feminism"", it was a yes or no question"
"""Men and Women are different but equal""
I agree because again, we are different biologically, mentally, and emotionally but our legal rights should be the same. Anyone disagree?"
"​ @netflix_and_chill20  men and women feel emotions and can think just as well. Or what do you mean by they're different mentally and emotionally?
Because they're different biologically since one has parts the other doesn't, but it's pretty clear they both feel love and hate, as well as have an equal capacity to reason."
"​ @regisglass5464  women process emotions differently than men. Men and women have different brains.

As for reason, please explain the variability hypothesis."
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv and what different parts of the brain do men and women have that they process emotions differently? 
As for the variability hypothesis, do you then mention it due to noting women have the same capacity to reason as men?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  then kindly write what brain parts science daily gives. And again, per the variability hypothesis, do you mention it per noting women have the same capacity to reason as men?
Seems odd you deflected."
 @regisglass5464  sometimes women and men react differently to different situations. Just like how men and women are all differently and don't act exactly the same🤷
"​ @regisglass5464 Your claim was that men and women are exactly the same, I'm responding to that.

This is what Science Daily said: ""It is known that women often consider emotional events to be more emotionally stimulating than men do. Earlier studies have shown that emotions influence our memory: the more emotional a situation is, the more likely we are to remember it. This raises the question as to whether women often outperform men in memory tests because of the way they process emotions. A research team from the University of Basel's ""Molecular and Cognitive Neurosciences"" Transfaculty Research Platform attempted to find out."""
"​ @regisglass5464  why don't you address the variability hypothesis? Don't you think that that effects the ability to reason? Men are less emotional. 

You, for example (a woman), are completely unreasonable and only argue based off of emotion."
"​ @regisglass5464  ""Several research studies and meta-analyses have shown small but significant gender differences in the expression of emotion in adulthood in the US and some Western European countries, with women showing greater emotion expression overal"""
"​ @regisglass5464  ""The brain is split into two halves, called hemispheres. Verma’s study found that men have more connections within each hemisphere of the cerebrum, linking the regions for planning and decision-making with the regions for sight and speech.

Women, on the other hand, have more connections between each hemisphere, allowing the two halves of the brain to share information more easily. In the cerebellum, the brain’s physics and motion calculator, the opposite was true—men had more connections between the two hemispheres, and women had more connections within each hemisphere.

"""
" @netflix_and_chill20  if men or women as a whole don't act the same, why state men and women as a group react differently to each other depending on the situation?"
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  as for your other quotes, thank you for agreeing men and women have the same capacity to reason, though it seems there's a probability that women outperform men in memory tests.
Is that why you avoid my query about the variability hypothesis because memory is fairly pertinent in regards to reasoning?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""Your claim was that men and women are exactly the same""
You are entitled to pretend so"
"​ @regisglass5464 , then why are women less reasonable on average? Note that you claimed that men and wonenare the exact same. 

Please kindly explain the variability hypothesis if men and women are the exact same."
​ @regisglass5464  you literally claimed that women and men are the exact same.
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  ""you literally claimed that women and men are the exact same.""
Then kindly quote me"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  you seem to disagree with your other sources and quotes that women have the same capacity to reason as men (one even says women outperform men in memory tests).
Is that why you avoid my query about the variability hypothesis? Is memory pertinent for a capacity to reason?"
​ @regisglass5464  except you literally did claim that men and women were the same
 @DavidW-ng5zv  you are still entitled to pretend so
"​ @regisglass5464  I mentioned the variability hypothesis because it shows the vast differences seen in men, which isn't seen in women. I want you to address it."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  still weird you ignore your sources
" @DavidW-ng5zv  as for the variability hypothesis, again, do you mention it because you believe men and women have the same capacity to reason? You seem to already agree they have the same brain parts after all."

" @regisglass5464  I never said men and women as a group react differently, I'm saying each individual reacts some what differently. As the majority of men react tough because it's implanted in their brain that theyre supposed to and women might think more deeply, freeze up, or act out of emotion. But some women might act a bit out of intellect and a bit out of emotion, and some men might act tough and a little bit out of emotion. each individual is different✨"
"​​​ @regisglass5464  men and women are different. Why can't you accept this?

It's weird how feminists seem to believe that there are no differences between men and women."

So basically this 2:25?"
"​​ @regisglass5464 , but men and women do have separate brains. My sources show it.

Why are men more interested in things while women are more interested in people if our brains are exactly the same as you claim?

To answer your question as well: I do not agree as I do not believe that men and women are equal."
 @regisglass5464  sure?
 @netflix_and_chill20  then i don't know what you were trying to explain if you agree with the feminists

He watched his nut sock become sentient and adapt to his room
Lot of comments say he looks like he smells like onions
He studied it on tumblr. Duh.
He dresses like a 4th grade white boy
he read articles by fox news
He doesn't even look like he went to high school lol 😂😅
your man looks like he’s STILL in high school
@Griffin Laing honestly anything is on the internet now
@Jeff B almost a thrid of men can't get laid? thats just sad bro
@Jeff B LMAOOOOOO speak for yourself
"@Jeff B I remember seeing those numbers a while back too. There were a few videos on YT about it and it died down after 2-3 months. It said 28% of men hadn't had sex in the past year, I just don't remember when it was done. Better yet is that it rose from 18% ten years ago or something along those lines. Tim Pool had a video or 2 on it."
Derrick is like that one annoying high schooler who can't graduate 10th grade
Mimi is beyond ignorant
derrick looks like he would call women “females”
"How many men's rights ralys have their been that feminists have turned up to and said ""ok... I respect your point of view ""?"
"Derrick can get women. He just needs to change everything about himself, and learn to take a shower every once in a while."
i know Derrick was trying so hard not to say 'females'
"Woosh, they using that word ""attack"" a LOT"
i was so convinced zach was ki hong lee
"Derrick subconcious:
”We Live In A Society”"
"The other male rights activist spoke their points and opinions respectively, where as the guy in the yellow acted childish such as scoffing, laughing, and making snarky remarks"
"The look in the ladies eyes when they're listening to Derrick talk about something is just hilarious. I can tell they were trying to be nice and force a smile, basically looking like the ""🙂"" emoji."
"Hey people, we have to raise money for a good cause: getting Derrick a therapist."
It's everyone against derrick 😂
Zach is the best guest
"I feel like the only one that was genuinely listening fir a middle ground was Zach,pretty much everyone else was angry at some point but Zach kept his cool like a frostbitten nutsack."
"I would love to see this video again, with 3 male feminist and 3 male men’s rights activists. And vis versa with 3 female feminists and 3 female men’s rights activists."
1:15 Prob because you just laughed at them having rights 💀
We can do this all day and still nothing changes just move on and live life
I feel like this would be better with a man feminist and a woman men's rights activist
I could tell from the jump Derrick was gonna be the annoying one
??
ikr omg.
I Am Ewon PERIOD.
Made In Heaven yes but when people regularly refer to them as females instead of women they’re kinda a neck beard.
No name Pie but we’re females😳😳
"nah i get it, theres a certain kind of person who calls women ""females"". we arent denying that women are females because, well duh, but yeah i know what you mean 😂 i hate when dudes do that, its gross. its like using ""smash"" for having sex"
Period🙌🏼
I dont know how anyone can take him seriously. Imo
" @marisemarrs  as an incel, I know and understand what drove him to where he is but I agree with pretty much nothing he said. For him it's all just a coping mechanism, blaming everything but himself and it's honestly sad. He's a horrible example, he claims he wants to bring positive light on incels but he's just making it 10x worse"
you smell his underarm?
fr the whole time i was thinking stank ass basketball shorts that he’s worn for a while month and greasy ass hair
😂😂😂
"Dr. Phillager why are you an incel? I truly mean no disrespect, but it’s very interesting."
Lmao thats facs
 @blazejecar  Why would you call yourself an incel? I'm sure you'd eventually find someone if you have a decent personality.
"​ @leoniemelodie7  you don't choose to be an ""incel"". It means involuntary celibate. It isn't a religious ideology or anything like that, itt's also not a death sentence like ""yea ok I'm never getting laid"" even though a lot of incels make it seem like that. I didn't give up at all and maybe I'll find someone down the line, but currently I am a virgin and I'm not so by my own volition. That's all an incel is."
" @blazejecar  Okay, then I guess that also makes me an incel, not that I would label myself as one. I wish you find someone to be happy with, actually I think everybody deserves it. I was more curious about what views do you have to feel like you belong to this community. I hope you don't just feel bad about yourself because I'm sure you're someone great. That'd be a waste to be discouraged about it, even though all of us are a little bit."
" @blazejecar   Gosh 😂 You're welcome, thank you for your explanation!"
"I say males and females all the time, there's nothing wrong with that lmao"
 @Michael-tm6vs  it’s only wrong if you use it in a derogatory way.

 @reinayates4080  Hate Derrick but I don't understand this stigma of saying 'females'. Isn't that a better term and more pro-trans movement than saying 'women'? Saying that 'women' should be the default term every single time is kinda giving me Rowling-vibes tbh.
That's what they are?
 @reinayates4080  it's never derogatory it's just science
 @reinayates4080  How can you call someone what they objectively are in a derogatory way?
 @danielcherisme6159  because people aren’t objects. So using female and woman interchangeably is incorrect and derogatory
first

I agree he was rude but I don’t think he should get this hate
He was brave in talking about his ideals and was confident. That’s pretty hard especially when this whole comment disagreed. Overall I think he had a valid point just the delivery wasn’t worded right as he needed assistance from the guy the grey shirt"

That person was brought here to cause controversy and he accomplished to do that. It brings entertainment. Such people are everywhere but their count is very small, almost insignificant. But media mostly gives them screen time to get more views."
 @christendsouza5845  then why are the MRAs that I've come into contact with think like him
" @asha_vere  because you have not contacted millions of them. Your case is like ""a fish in a pond thinks that's the whole world"". 
Now according to your same logic, what if I say that all the feminists that I've seen were naked psychotic people. Are most of them like that? No of course not. Most feminists as well as MRAs are reasonable people."

" @asha_vere  you get attacked by the society- yes I accept. But you have to also accept that men get attacked by the law, the same law and structure of the society for which MRAs are fighting against."
 @christendsouza5845  lol really? Because that's never what I get told that MRAs are fighting for. And it's not society that attacks me and fellow women. It's men. Point blank. Particularly MRAs.
" @asha_vere  then they are not really MRAs and just pure sexists. Again, watch the Ted talks which I mentioned above, you will know."
 @christendsouza5845  y'all need to go after them then instead of feminists haha
" @asha_vere  If you are not fighting for equality that affects men negatively, you are fighting for superiority because you have all right without all the negatives.
If a woman wants to vote, she votes.
If a man wants to vote, he has to register for the draft.
You are receiving a privilege without paying into the system."
" @christendsouza5845  there shouldn't be a draft in the first place. In other areas of hard labor like mining or construction, women are conditioned not to pursue jobs like that. I've known female truck drivers and construction workers although far an few in between. Also consider that companys that hire for physical labor generally hire men for those positions off the strength that they are men. It seems as though you are mad that women don't want to participate in institutions that were created BY MEN."
" @23imsoawesome  I know what you are saying and completely get it. But you completely missed my point.
No matter what kind of job, current feminism will ask for equal opportunity and quotas if money and power is involved, even if that job would specifically be strength centric. 
And if that job is filthy and minimum wage, or jobs which cause mental stress on highest level you don't see any feminists there. Get it?"
 @christendsouza5845  I mean I get what you're saying but I feel as though that's not a trait only reminiscent of feminists. Nobody wants to work a minimum wage job or any job that's highly stressful. Maybe that's where men tend to fall in the cracks bc again I've met women who are willing to do those jobs. This sounds moreso like it needs to be a nationwide reform within the system rather than an attack on feminism.
" @23imsoawesome  oh my God. Seriously. Who attacked feminism? We are attacking a farce which is present day feminism. Google feminism: the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes. The hypocrisy of present day feminists is that they want equality in power and wealth positions and completely ignore or even acknowledge the other sex's problem.
IF THEY HAD HONORED THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF FEMINISM THEN THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR MGTOW.
Get it? Sayonara, never responding here again.
Sorry for being rude, but when explaining obvious things again and again it feels like speaking to a wall."
 @christendsouza5845  There was never any need for MGTOW. You're blaming the entire movement and not the specific people within that movement who do that. Honestly. You're not understanding what I'm saying because you don't want to.
" @christendsouza5845  I'm not even a feminist. Lol how am I taking anything as an attack? You're too blinded by anger to even hear me. I'm telling you that you're mad at the wrong people. Me personally, I don't take mainstream feminism seriously bc it only advocates really for white women. How I feel I should instead of being mad at them for not fighting a battle they can't empathize with, start my own movement instead. All I'm saying is if you feel like these problems are not being taken seriously, fight for yourself and not AGAINST mainstream feminism."
I don't think he's trying to be rude I see someone with a bit of public speaking anxiety
 @moberry8641  maybe. Doesn't change the fact that he's condescending asf
His face speaks of his maturity level.
 Angry Egalitarian  lol.
"Okay but the women were getting really defensive over the fact that they didn't actually have anything to say back, and they kinda just started repeating stuff."
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It seems just painful to me.
Can’t really blame them 🤣
They look angry they are not smiling
" @tarasuzanne7867  I'm aware it is. Derick's point isn't helping men and especially women. That's the problem of men who claim to be ""men's rights activists"" is the only time they bring it up, is to go against women's rights activists. A feminist talks about a problem, such as a woman getting r@ped, what happens after is the pressed men comment things like ""how about men?"" Or ""men go through the same thing"". And I'm pretty sure everyone knows it also happens to men, the problem is that they're trying to make about men, when clearly the problem is about a woman. I teach my brothers that this also happens to men and that they shouldn't be scared to open up about it because young boys are taught to not show emotions. I get your point, laughing at a problem that is a real thing happening. And I'm sorry. I'm very much trying."
Jack Torrance There's no therapist good enough to fix THAT...
Nicolás Perchner how about he needs to spend years doing things for other people. And needs to get out of the 1700’s era
Has anyone ever met someone like Derrick? because I definitely have not
Lmao agreed! He was my favorite.
“Kept his cool like a frost bitten nutsack” thank you for this gem
I know I may not be important but I am the 100 like.
Of this comment
I felt like all the guys were good the women were aggressively attacking like weridos they didnt make sense at all
" @Kynxis  Bea was the only female that actually listened, agreed, and brought up valid points."
 Selina Kyle  Derrick was making good points tho he wasnt doing it in the best manner but he was bringing facts and all the other guys aswell the women were aggressively questioning with no follow up and with barley any facts
 Selina Kyle  did you not see the women's ?? well that's typical blaming the man but the women is fine SMH
" @Kynxis  I think the men knew they would be judge (since it would have been posted), I agree that some women were agressive and try to keep they cool and stay polite. But I can understand why they were agressive. When you reach puberty that you get sexual jokes (not just one) and then you know that each time you go out of your place something will happen to you no matter how you a dressed, that your arguments are not recognized then a guy say the exact same word and here evryone listen,  that you will never have the chance to travel like a man without being told that it is your fault if something happens,that you are looked upon because you consider a man has been abused (mentaly and/or physically), yes you feel like the opposing group is not comprehending your life. Only in one country I (at this point you guessed that I am a woman) NEVER felt all of the above. It was in a country where women are given equal respect and men equal opportunities (paternity leaves): Sweden. Feminism is not about only women, it advocate for equal rights. It is true its origins focused on women only, but as of today the movement seeks equality and thus it includes men (see HeforShe mvt). But as seens with the men's right group in this video, feminism is an idea that includes variations and that means that unfortunately there is men haters.... I don't get their opinions on getting rid of men. That is indeed madness. But it is also madness to say we should go back like before. What before? Societies have been patriarchal and also matriarchal, not so far children were put to jail because they were caught with no money (see older French Republic in the early 20ecentury). 
Sorry for the long post. Thanks for the one that had been brave enough to read all of it. ;)"

" @Kynxis  I agree at some point. Some were getting emotional probably due to fustration linked to the fact they don't seem to understand what is the daily life (litteraly) of a women. It is no joke, fear is a real thing. The men here had good point, that could have been better challenged. But their view was not really in opposition. However, Derrick was different. His view and exprience were contradictory and actually matched the argument of women. He says that women would be happier to the way it has been before. Before, rape was a thing but did not really exist in the legal system then when it was society judged women rather than the act that had been done. Women could not open a bank account, become financially independant and leave the side of the husband. Women should only care for children. Well that is seen as a female job but what about the dad? Studies shown that children are likely to find their neighbour more familiar or other men than their own father because the father is expected to work but to bring money. This lead to mental distress to both the child and the father (the why that paternity leaves is a given in scandinavian nations). I don't think a matriarchy is any better. Derrick views seem to be more nostalgic of a time where he could have gained a certainty in hierchy in the social pyramid and assure him a certain level of worth and superiority. In other word, he not against women but he is not looking for their well being either. Derrick is looking for status that can be observed. Derrick did well in keeping in check his frustration but he is human and who would not be angry when one think differently on something you believe so strongly about."
 @mauddescamps7572 I got no  problem of women getting equal rights to men but I'm just saying the women in this video were taking it a completely different direction and being way to aggressive and not really listening to the opposing side
KenHitThose yes they were but also Derek I feel like was taking the aggression of being an incel out on woman which turned him very sexist
" Selina Kyle  they said nothing sexist, they were trying to stay calm sitting opposite this smirking misogynist dude Derrik who would happily see one of them snap at his behaviour. Please don't bother talking or responding to one of his fellow incel buddies commenting here. It's like feeding a very angry incel troll."
 Selina Kyle  tell me when did I ever say they were sexist  plz tell me
 Selina Kyle  no one was sexist  Simple  Yall weridos if yall think any different
YES
"Would have been so much more interesting or, it would just have been better, this was too two sided, or too similar on both sides might be a better way to put it"
Omgg yessss
Imagine trying to find 3 female men's rights activists 😂
Jubilee please see this
Interesting
I agree that this would have been a more productive and ethical conversation. The women in this video should not have been subjected to this. Jubilee- Please don’t do this again where one group is inherently prejudice and has a history of harm against the other group.
brilliant
YES
 @user-wx5dp  disculpe?
 @user-wx5dp  yes they can
YUP !
Male feminist?  That’s like literally saying Cat Dog
@Adam Zahavi that's not true Men's rights and Women's rights are different topics and not connected in the same level Women's rights is definitely a bigger  problem then Men's rights but both are important and people like you hurt the progress of Men's rights in a toxic way Women's rights are important and men can be feminist allys while also being pro Men's rights.
"Yesssss especially the first one that you said, with 3 male feminist and 3 male men’s rights activist"
FACTS
 @bjmr1993  I’ve seen 2 on tiktok but I only remember the name of one
YEA👏🏻👏🏻
 @trailerwithyardwasteonit7188  I saw a few male feminist YouTuber a before actually.
 @mr.mirage3986  I actually meet a few before and saw a few male feminist YouTubers. I know it’s surprising but it’s true
" @ruthie_chie   and I saw a person who identifies as an attack helicopter, I guess u really can be anything u want now days"
Or 3 male feminists and 3 female men's rights activists 😂
" @e-styles8761  That’s the whole point. They’ve had cops and felons, they have Israelite and Palestinians. Etc etc etc"
THIS. YES.
I would love to see a video where Derrick whoops you
Draco Malfoy don’t think they exist there partner
Right
"There are many male feminists, but I doubt there exist more than a few female MRA's as they engage in self-destructive behaviour"
"There should be more women to stand up for men's rights tho, they should NOT generalize all men by the actions of the bad men.. I mean there is a lot of bad women with toxic behavior, not just men.."
Totally agree
Could've had at least one male feminist in there
Kalks some of the most well known mra’s are women (youtuber Girlwriteswhat) and saying that they are self-destructive because they standup for men’s issues is a bit lame.
Skirt Sam I’m a male feminist
 @verikcingeto6650  Feminism provides the solutions that MRA's are looking for.
Rightttt smh
"MoonShine Bri I think feminists and women in generals issue with MRA’s is that their supposed advocacy appears as actually a group created as a response to feminism. It gives a pretty spiteful impression, as when you visit forums, YT channels etc most of the discussion revolves around all the evils of women."
I don't think they exist
Go outside for a day and engage with real actual people instead of internet yellers and you'll experience that a lot if not most women don't associate with radical feminism
 @skirtsam1441  Honeybadgers - female MRAs they exist
"I,  a male feminist, is down to try that experiment."
"Question for the feminist. Would you tell your son to man up? No? Then why do y'all assume that ""our"" parents did?"
Does the latter exist?
" @DragonSkaterrr   we don't ""assume"" that. We experienced that. I see that in my father, in myself, in my younger brother, how my father is telling him to ""man up"" because he is crying. He is five. 

I always tell him that he shouldn't say that, because that will make him have a very low self-esteem and is putting him in a box from a very young age where he doesn't even understand it. He then is always raging up and telling me, that this is, what a man is supposed to be, otherwise, he is none. That makes me always sad, because, i do see, where he is coming from, but when i look at my brother, who wants to let his emotions out, but can't, because our father is around. It makes me so so sad.

Feminism isn't about hating men, or telling them what to do. The way i see it, it is about letting men have a diversity in emotions and let them have the ability to express them fully. It is also about getting women equal Rights under the law, but that isn't the topic right now.

I do hope you have the ability to Express yourself freely, because some people (in this case men) can't."
 @queenempress82  you realise there's a lot of feminists with critiques of how societal standards can be harmful to men.
Draco Malfoy I agree but we can’t get an authentic opinion from them since they are basically “switching sides”
"EXACTLY man, I thought the same!"
Yess
" @LOgomon20  
Feminist: ""Society hurts men too.""
MRA: ""I agree, how do we fix it?""
Feminist: ""Blame men for all the problems of society"""
"Freeze Peach 

Don't think that's how that works"
YES. 100% agree with this comment. This was my first thought in this video
I'm a male feminist
 @LOgomon20  I do😊
 @CavemanSynthesizer  nice strawman you got there bro.
" @CavemanSynthesizer  MRA: ""society hurts men too.""
Feminist: ""I agree. How do you think we should fix it?""
MRA: ""Blame feminism for all of societys problems.""

See I can do it too.

Edit: forgot a question mark."
I'm a woman. I'm an egalitarian. There arent many women men right activist bc they just realise they are egalitarian
"​ @LOgomon20  It's a little simplified, but it's pretty much the lens that feminists look at men's problems through. 

Almost any social issue that men face is boiled down to (basically) ""well, why can't they be less like men and more like women!"" Because they're looking at men's issues with a feminist paradigm, which almost by definition can't look at any aspect of femininity, women or (gasp!) feminism as negatively effecting men. And if you only look at half of the problem, you're only going  to see half of the solution which ends up being that (""obviously"") the only thing that can fix men's problems is... (drum roll)... more feminism!

They're not really interested in fixing men's problems, they're trying to fix men."
" @CavemanSynthesizer  these are still all are baseless asertions  on what you feel femenisem is.

I have heard better and deeper analysis on how societal gender norms are harming men then ""men should be more like"". 
And I have heard plenty of feminist analysis on how societies female gender norms can be harmful. I have heard plenty of critiques made by feminsts on other feminists theory and praxis.

Also you don't criticize as MRA's lack of solutions to the problems that women face. Seems kind like a double standard.

In conclusion your entire take just seems like a bad meme people have been circulating about feminism for a while now."
"​ @LOgomon20  Okay, first off: I don't know what you mean by ""female gender norms."" It could mean a number of things.


If you mean that there are feminists who are critical of the ways that men and boys are held to feminine standards of behavior by society I have never heard any popular feminist make that claim, although I've heard a few (Christina Hoff Sommers and Camille Paglia come to mind) who are persona non-grata in the feminist movement because they criticize modern feminism's flawed approach to gender relations.


Secondly I don't criticize MRA's lack of solutions to female problems, because MRA's don't generally insert themselves into women's issues. They don't advocate and support policies that are discriminatory towards women or create legal or legislative double standards based on sex. The difference is that the feminist movement is VERY concerned with govt. regulations and social sanctions against men, whereas MRA's main purpose is to oppose those same regulations and social sanctions and (AFAIK) don't propose any legal or social double standards against women.


Finally in the very unlikely event that there are feminists who are concerned with men's issues (obvious exceptions excepted) their first move should be to listen to men and not to dismiss criticism of feminism by men out of hand, don't ""dismiss their lived experience"" as one might put it."
"Yup I looked at the comments before the video loaded and just saw derick getting canceled (As they should)
Saw the middle part and immediately went “That’s derick”"
derrick is an alpha
 @imraw087  mhm.
"BRO I SAW IT COMING I LOOKED AT THE VIDEO AND I WAS LIKE ""istg every sexist guy looks like that""💀"
 @zoeyelena64  fr haha idk if you’ve seen it but they also did a video where people ask an incel questions and ofc it was Derrick. Ngl that video made me feel kinda bad for him. Still don’t like him though lol
Dudes feet can’t even touch the floor when he’s sitting 😭
the INSTANT he self identified himself as an incel - WITH DEFINITION 🧍🏻‍♀️
i knew the SECOND he identified himself as an incel
Derrick has never talked to a woman besides his mom before this and it shows
derek definitely seems like he wants women to like him because ‘hes a man’ rather than because they genuinely like him as a person because clearly theres not much to like and maybe he knows that lol
"I respect the other two mens rights activists, but Derrick? Derrick makes me very angry und I dont know how to handle it"
"""I don't hate women... I just... I just""

I just what Derrick? Say it please."
Men's Rights vs. Feminists vs. Derrick: Is Derrick real?
Bro Derrick isn’t protecting anyone. I feel like if I poked him he would tumble over.
Feminist or not I think there is no arguement about Derek being a jerk
and Derrick really wonders why he can't get any women at all to like him.....LOLLLLL OKAY
at the start it looked interesting cause I could see a woman in the men's rights corner but to my surprise it was in fact Derrick
"Ok fine mimi, if I see you get attacked on the street by 6‘6 guys, I no not to worry because you can protect yourself 👏"
I’m glad everyone agrees that Derrick is not the brightest 💀
I would have loved to see a male feminist and a female anti-feminist among the groups
10:39 I wish the biggest problem in my life was VOLUNTARILY wearing coombait clothing so I don’t get talked to by people who desire me
"""uhh I only came with anecdotal evidence my dude."""
"Derrick: I’m an incel
Me: this should be fun"
derrick isn’t a men’s rights activist if that’s actually his thoughts about women
All did great especially Zach and Bea. All women need to stay away a dm watch out for Derrick because bruh…
"15:01 I felt for Alyesha when she talked about being treated unfairly by the system. I believe that behavior is terrible and disgusting. Men should never become violent when a woman says no. I have experienced this myself. When I have turned down a woman's advances, it has always ended in that person trying to destroy my friendships, relationships, or my social circle through lies and gossip. Men are physically violent women are socially violent. I don't necessarily agree that it comes from a system. I think some men and women are just disgusting in different ways. But I do agree if either happen, people should step in to stop either scenario."
I like Zack and Bea. Zack 100% wanted to actually listen and learn. Bea is 100% all for equal rights
"Derrick: ""I do have empathy...for women being lost/misguided lol"". 
pans over to visibly irritated faces"
I honestly think he’s insecure about his personality but that does not excuse his behavior
I also think with his statement about how it wouldnt be bad of we went back to the olden days and abt how it would be happier really speaks just from a mans perspective considering he was referring to the time of men and women getting married then every day the man goes off the work and the woman stays home and takes care of the kids and if we still did that it wouldn't be happy for most women because these days women have dreams and want jobs other than housewife stay at home mom
" @ellarae6647  Agreed, because I'd love to stay at home as a man"
You read him like a book
..
"He has an ego and is so disrespectful towards the three girls, she literally asked him a question and he laughed in her face."
You don’t know how to handle it? Just don’t watch the video lol
"Idk why you respect the other 2. They're all like ""women should raise the kids"" in one breath and then ""it's not fair how women keep getting custody in family court! This is discrimination!"" in the next. They're literally causing their own problems and fail to see the irony of it."
"Keiome Nikke yeah, I didn’t know the other two said that though but yeah I don’t respect any of them"
"Just say it truthfully 
Derrick is built like a m1a1 abram from cod"
"Keiome Nikke i think they’re really confused about what they opinions are, but i respect them as people

Derric otherwise is not just his ideals that i disagree but the way he treated the other side like them were less, i can’t respect that"
Ja ich verstehe
"larry, You don’t know how to be nice? No reply to this comment lol"
"Keiome Nikke, Right i feel like MRA are just something to go against Feminism, because the whole time they never talked about men’s experiences in an every day life getting mistreated while women have plenty they can share"
larry tell me you don’t follow Derrick on youtube
"Become German. I don't know how that'll help you handle with Derrick's ignorance, but it'll help with your German... 

Und is German for and, yes? Or is it Unt?"
He just really doesn't favour or cater to homosaipens of the opposing gender to the Male..
Derriks right in some ways but wrong in others
Rafael Vasconcelos 😂😂😂💀
Wait Derrick is an incel what is he doing here? Lol
 @rafaelvasconcelos117  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💔💔💔💔💔
 @whyareyouhere365  Ikr we already know that he will be against every women
 @whyareyouhere365  you can be an incel and a mens rights activist
"u h

i'm a female and i think my gender's overrated what do i do"
Derrick is awesome
 @dont8038  fuck yeah dude
Jimmy TZBL bro?? you’re tripping💀
"God, help this thread."
 @dont8038  jeez you and I have VERY different definitions of awesome :)
 @riddhisharma7285  I guess we do😁
" @dont8038  Yeah man, he really is ''awesome"""
 @riddhisharma7285  thanks
Maddie Joyner He actually wonders that God I thought it was obvious
Just listening to Derrick made me lose brain cells
RIGHT
HIS HAIR LOOKS LIKE IT WAS DIPPED IN OIL🏃‍♀️💨
LMAO right
 @ameliapiner9245 thaenks
 @ameliapiner9245  lmao yes
he don't even shine 😭
"even though he tries soo hard to project he is...my take is that he was beat out, maybe academically, by a girl when he was younger and now has this hatred toward women😅"
Korsat was the only smart person there.
I'm damn sure the chair has a higher IQ than him
"""us being allies in a patriarchy wouldnt be so bad. us going back to the past wouldn't be so bad"" literally the most broken light in the room"
anyone know his social medias? I feel like bullying him
samee
I mean... Derrick was close enough
Omg! Among! Among us sussy Baja imposter!!!!!
"Why did you call it an anti-feminist when the other side shown in this debate was men's rights? 
You are aware those aren't the same things right?"
that would've been interesting
That'd be interesting!
 @alisyedhasany6594  yea but they're literally saying they don't agree with the ideology of feminism....so tomatoes tomahtoes 🤷‍♀️
Agreed i think it would be an interesting idea
" @lemon4087  mens rights isnt anti feminism. its not interchangeable. mens rights are more towards problems like young men being drafted into war without wanting to, men not being considered as victims of rape in certain countries due to the wording of the laws(literally even an industrialized nation such as the U.K.), and the the cycles of abuse and poor environment that continues due to lack of mental and emotional support for men. feminism is based on trying to make women have the same rights as men. anti feminism would be saying that women shouldnt have the same rights as men, but thats not what mens rights are about."
 @user-bv3yy8sq3f  thank you. Feminism is searching for equality for women. Men's rights is all about drawing attention to and fixing problems men and young men face.
" @balorthedreamer6792  it bothers me so much when people think that mens rights and feminism cant exist together peacefully. at the end of the day they both have the same goal of bettering society, so lets focus on that"
" @lemon4087  no it's very different. 
They don't support a movement. That doesn't make them hate them. 
I don't like my brother doesn't mean I hate him.  
Men's rights activist basically has a ideology that they want to be fair . That both side get equal right which is also what feminist say but the change is that they want to point out discrimination  a men face where feminist basically has focus on female 
That's also reason sometimes they are fighting together too"
" María Chiavassa  there ARE men feminists tho. its just men also fighting for equal rights for women. its the same concept as white people protesting alongside blacks for the end of segregation. inherently, the fight is with the ideology. not any specific group of people."
" María Chiavassa  so, to confirm I understand what you are saying, men cannot be feminists? In what sense? Like can we not be called feminists but can supposed them? Or do we just have to take a neutral stance on the whole matter and not even support them? I can understand the first idea, but the second....."
 María Chiavassa  why shouldnt they help protest for equality? it would HELP build bridges instead walls by having both sides agree and fight for the same thing. why wouldnt you want that?
 @mgraffius084  Baja blast from taco bell🤔🤔🤔
" María Chiavassa  Yes, they can call themselves feminists if they share feminist points of view."
" @alisyedhasany6594  yes but these three men arent even advocates for mens rights. mens rights talks about how men should be able to express emotions without having to face the ""wrath of society"" and sexual assaults that men go throughh. these men were just talking about how they dont agree with feminism and that women dont struggle every day"
Co 😂nfused
 @ethancole1734  😂😂😂
Same
"To all the people who replied to me: The girls, they understand n the differences btw feminism n men's rights n are in this debate with an open mind. The guys tho, oof 😣 they outright disagreed with the ideology of feminism. So in here, men's rights can also be said as anti feminism cuz duh 🤷‍♀️🙄"
Me too
 @user-bv3yy8sq3f  thats what i should be about* but  the reality is that is just a reactionary movement and one that lives  only in the internet
" @lemon4087  Not really. But anyways even if that is the case, it's not a bad thing. I'm not a feminist as a female"
" @alisyedhasany6594  because they meant a whole other group of people, it’s a different group not the same as men’s rights activists"
 @lemon4087  no
"Anti-feminist... just... I'll let that one sink in. As a men's rights activist and a feminist, this... confuses me"
exactly
That’s exactly what I thought right from the start!
you mean make rights activists?
Honestly of I did men
same omg
 @spaingelmarroquin8270  THE TRANSLATION HAHAHAHAHA
Was about to comment that.
" @alisyedhasany6594  difference being that men’s rights activists accept the rights women drive for, feminism is one way traffic…feminism has never campaigned against an issue that affects men"
"@Ichigo-Kun  in that case, name a men’s rights issue that feminism has fought against…you can’t, feminism debunked"
 @ethancole1734  that made not sense
" @ethancole1734  Derrick wasn't a men's advocate, he was a discord moderator lmaooo"
" @ethancole1734  I'm sorry, I'm bias against discord.. my bad"
" @lemon4087  I think that's because of what women see it and think it is, vs what it actually *IS*.. and women don't see their own creation"
" @user-bv3yy8sq3f  Yea, the common misconception that women have is that they think men's rights is about tearing down feminism, or taking away the spotlight of women's problems. Us as men, we understand what you go through. Not pain for pain, but we DO feel you. But everytime we try to show that we understand you, we are pushed away and told ""No you don't if yoir for men's rights"". We don't want to downplay what you go through, we just want to be included in the equation of finding a solution of an embettering society"
" @user-bv3yy8sq3f  I think what drives people away the most is the name. The name ""feminism"" is very misleading, as fem means ""female"" not the word ""equal"". I think if the name were changed to better suit the definition, a lot more people would understand.. Cuz if you are paying attention, the name does NOT fit the definition one bit"
" @Vicky-uy7tb  From what I understand feminist just have points of veiw that any decent person should have. The beleive that everyone is equal. By that logic that would imply that ""Whatever has the decent person ideals, means it's feminism"" that doesn't make sense.."
 @lemon4087  tff
"@Ichigo-Kun  Then don't call it feminism, as fem means female, not just women. This is the logic that so many can't see"
Same this was pretty stereotypical
anti feminist? 💀
That is not anti-feminist. Duh.
" @Emkito  the questions they were asked weren't geared towards the MRA perspective
Only feminisms perspective"
Definitely would be more balanced and interesting
being a mens rights activist doesn't make you an anti feminist
" @Emkito not true, for one this was a longer debate cut into less then half an hour. Secondly when they did get into those topics they cut into a completely different part of the convo,"
"It all ties back to American individualist success culture. We tell ppl to live a life of success and achieve greatness so much so that it leads to women prioritizing the best 🧬s. 
While men associate it moreso with money & career status.

That’s why they feel like the need to dress like sloots:

“Here in Germany, girls are picky and won't just immediately jump onto any attractive guy since we have an abundance of tall HTNs and Chads (attractive men); even chads need decent game in 🇩🇪. I've lived in the US for a year, and it is ridiculous how different the girls are compared to Germany, even if they are ethnically similar to each other. In the US, I had met beckies whose first sentence to me literally was ""would you f me"". Something like that is completely unthinkable and ridiculous in Germany, but apparently the norm overseas.
— a German aspie chadlite”"
This boy so bitter about women cause they don’t wanna sleep with him. Which is a sense of entitlement in itself
 @giordanobruno1333  Rightfully so in my opinion. It can be pretty infuriating to listen to someone try to explain why you aren't worth as much as they are. I think these women are fully in their right to be a bit pissed off
"Hanne myrvoll 

That’s the problem. So easily triggered. She hated him before he even spoke. Her misandry is evident."
"Hanne myrvoll 

He never said anything about their worth, but they sure quickly judged his. Before he even spoke.

Your misandry is evident.

Why do you hate men?"
" @giordanobruno1333  I can already tell that I would be wasting my time if I started discussing this with you, because you keep putting words in my mouth and you're clearly not going to attempt to understand my side. So I'll just leave this here, I've said what I wanted to say"
"Hanne myrvoll 

What’s to discuss? You seem to agree with me. Misandry ok. Misogyny not.

Feminist equality in action"
 @giordanobruno1333  Misandry is deemed okay in society because we live in a patriarchy
" @giordanobruno1333  Misapplying terms like ""ad hominem"" doesn't make your point stronger. It makes you look like an internet pseudo-philosopher. 


Protip: If you want to have a conversation or a debate with someone, engage with what they actually wrote. Not with the reductive argument you wanted them to write, so it would be easier to argue against (i.e. Strawman Argument). Otherwise, you're having a conversation with yourself and your own projected thoughts, not with an actual person."
Hanne myrvoll but they’re right tho. Us women are hypocrites period no tampon
 @itsTarbs  ong
LOL Dude said we are in a fallen state AMAZIN!
Read the comments before the guests introduced themselves and immediately knew who Derrick was when he first appeared
itsTarbs Ong
"David Boucard 

Ad hominem is the correct term.

She attacked my character instead of my argument with her comment, “you wouldn’t understand”. “I can already tell I would be wasting my time.”


Sorry if you don’t know your logical fallacies. If she had addressed my argument, maybe, but all she did was question my character.

Thanks for playing

“I can already tell I would be wasting my time.”

Why? Because I’m a man with a different opinion? That proves my point. Misandry is ok. Go ahead, insult me more. Question my character. Pre judge me that I, not my argument, are not worth your time.

Do that to a woman.....that’s just wrong. Misogyny is wrong. Misandry is right."
"Mind Over Matter 

Misandry, the hatred of men, is ok because we live in a patriarchy, a society ruled by men.

That makes no sense.

That’s feminist equality. You can only hate one group. Men. Kick a man in the balls. Comedy gold. Assault a man. Funny and acceptable. Rape a man. Nobody bats an eye.

Do any of these things to a woman, or less, and it is not acceptable.

That doesn’t sound like a patriarchy."
"David Boucard 

Notice the commenter said that Derrick deserved derision. “Rightfully so” in her mind.

Misandry is a public good. Hatred of men is acceptable.

I’ll start having compassion for women’s rights and equality when they recognize misandry is also a bad thing. But according to feminist equality, men are bad. To display misandry, the hatred of men is a societal good.

Did it make you feel better to insult and denigrate me and Derrick? You really showed us."
"Giordano Bruno they are bitter because derrick thinks of them as lesser. he thinks they are like children who have a set role in society (childbearing and marriage). that viewpoint is damaging. derrick from the getgo comes across as ego driven and entitled and that’s not even me trying to insult him, that’s just true. he calls himself an incel because he thinks he is entitled to affection from a woman without putting in any effort to respect them. he doesn’t seem to view them as equal minded humans, just a part of life he deserves. if someone thought of you that way surely that would piss you off. there’s no misandry in wanting respect"
" @giordanobruno1333  You are very on point, cheers !"
It's Wazzupiddy Derek is my boi
should get the birdman on this
@SimD 75 no words.
the rest  of the femenist werent for equal rights ?
 @nerdybones8415  did I say that
 @nerdybones8415  No 0:57
 @nerdybones8415  im a feminist. And your false. Im pretty sure feminism is fighting for the rights for woman to be as equal as men. Or at least what i think and I am a feminist. Plus Idk if its only in my religion but were also supposed to be equal.
" @nerdybones8415  mimi went in the agressive against the French dude outlet because he had research to backup his statement and she didn’t and he knew her that her statement was false while the other darker skinned woman- forgot her name sorry- was purely just agressive the majority the time and refused to listen, bea,French guy, and Zach were all in my opinion how do I put it just the more publicly agreed upon points like I respect their points more than the others not that I don’t validate the other points- also Derrick although trying his best was just horrible"
 @nikkohaddon5316  I think the darker skinned woman have had more hands-on experience thus being more straightforward since to be frank she falls through the cracks of intersectionality so she encounters more incidents where some parts of the society would judge her even more due to her gender and her race simultaneously.
" @zhizhang5353  We cannot know for sure about that, this is just an assumption. Still, one cannot justify her behaviour."
" @zhizhang5353  she used an anecdotal experience to try to attack all men; that’s not how this works.

The Latina woman behaved even worse.

Bea was the only “feminist” that tried to listen and hear the other side."
I agree. I like Bea.
 @ladylovelylocks  It used to be that but now it's seems to be about supremacy and misandry. I'm sure there are still people like you who are just about equal rights but what gets pushed in the media is pretty toxic. Ive called myself egalitarian for the last ten years.
"Yeah, like on the Male Rights activists side, Zach was the only one who seemed to genuinely be there for hearing the other side and less like... spouting activist stuff"
 @Thefoxygamer1  the problem is every single woman I know has these experiences. She also made it clear she didn't mean all men but ok bud
 @nikkohaddon5316  i think the darker skinned woman (her name is aleysa) was more agressive because she had had bad experiences with toxic men and when asked what was so bad about the men she encountered she got angry because it once again felt like men were trying to shut her down. i do agree with everything else you said. derrick was a jerk
feminism is actually not equal rights
 @davidevignato5037  the true definition of feminism is equal rights for all. Modern feminist have forgotten that
 @devin_so_devious  alright then
 @mrmoo156  sure
" @nerdybones8415  as that one tweet says, you can say you like pancakes and someone would reply ""so you don't like pancakes?"""
" @ladylovelylocks  Are you fighting for equality of opportunity or equality of outcome?  Because one of them, women already have, and the other is a dangerous precedence to fight for"
" @AKAPRODUCTIONS21  true,and thats why I'm saying their not true feminists,the whole point of feminism,is to fight for the equality to be as equal as men,were not taking men's rights,but we want ours to be equal as them."
" @davidevignato5037  it was meant to be that way. The ""feminists"" you see on tiktok,aren't true feminists,feminism to me,means fighting for the rights to be as equal as a man's,were not taking their rights,but we want ours to be as equal as their rights. Men and women were made to care for eachother,not r4p3 and s3xu4lly assault eachother."
 @ladylovelylocks  yeah I agree
" @devin_so_devious  thankfully i haven't. What people think ""feminism"" is just makes everything worse."
"Those women are not for equal rights, they want superority and special treatment. THAT IS NOT FEMANISM. Listen to how rude they are"
" @Whatareyoudoinnhere  as a equal rights feminist,zach and bea were probably the most understanding ,this whole time. From both sides too."
" @Whatareyoudoinnhere  bea actually tried to ask questions,and awnser some. Zack was doing the same thing,Derrick was just a misogynist,others were quiet,most of the video."
 @Whatareyoudoinnhere  SERIOUSLY. every thing he said was completely false...
 @nerdybones8415  no the6 we’re for rights for women not equality
" @ladylovelylocks  feminism is the equality for the genders - that doesn’t specify that women r at a lower ground than men which they aren’t - some at a higher ground than most men ,some have a lower ground than most men"
 @LusciousTwinkle  thank you for your brilliant opinion ❤❤
 @ollieknox8309  Which opinion?
" Matt Jones  Bro, think what you will about women/feminists, but if that's his answer to ""I feel sympathy for the other side"" at the end of segment where he had to listen to the hardships of these 3 women... The scowling was well deserved."
 @curtd.9629  ily thank you
@Matt Jones Derrick that you?
tbh I think that guy was just here to offend  people and roast as much people as he could. Like he must have been paid to say that lmao
" Matt Jones  Bro what, explain how they got brainwashed exactly."
 Matt Jones  the fact that people like you actually exists is genuinely terrifying to me
 Matt Jones  That defeats the whole purpose of this video. They were working to understand each other’s sides and the he says this.
" Matt Jones  If that’s the case, men have also been misguided."
i feel like derrick is that one person who enters a room and everyone groans
Everyone just deserves to be treated equally. No one is better than anyone else.
"“Getting married, having kids”  but in the olden days people where not YouTuber they worked 9-5 jobs"
Hate how they cut out parts of their sentences (where there may be useful context) but it’s Jubilee I guess
"Inviting Derrick is like inviting the blue haired, raging feminist covered in badges and pins for the other side. 

Jubilee really invited him without any attempt to undermine the men’s rights side?"
"Title: feminism vs men’s rights
Reality: Derrick vs everyone"
"Derrick: ""I'm also an incel"" 
Oh no. Oh no oh no oh no."
"Listen, im a feminist, but these girls missed the ball crazy hard💀"
It's always feeling these ladies can never just say anything without saying that they feel this way feeling don't care about facts
>Not getting a male feminist and a female men's rights activist
Zach looks like a chill person and probably knows how to take care of himself and I dont think he is anti-feminism. Derrick needs learn some matters ngl and this is coming from a boy.
That black chick just proved his point.
Who else saw Derrick being extremely immature by laughing after every prompt was given.
"looks at comments, who’s derrick

looks at the guys

Oooooooooooo"
Damn these women were hostile asf
"I don't understand this toxic masculinity, it's not guys that are putting down men for being emotional, it's women. Women don't want a guy to act like a woman it turns them off"
Derrick acts like women purposefully stays away from him yet he admits that he doesn't want to be friends with women. Cringe. 💀
"No one:
Derrick: Im a incell but that doesn’t mean i hate women"
Derrick is everyone’s depiction of a Discord mod
This video seems to be very edited and I would prefer to watch it in it’s entirety. Sincerely.
except derick
Someone is always gonna be better. Equality is unattainable
Zoe Kanu I’m sorry that you feel that way
"I mean... zoe's not wrong, some people are just better than other people"
Crebelcombs Yeah. Like many people are better than derrick.
Except Derrick everyone is better than him
Except Derrick
"Zoe Kanu Well, that’s technically true but in front of a judge everyone should be equals.      ( sorry about my English )"
"Nah bruh, feminism has turned into a movement to become superior against men."
Mapleram unfortunately
Thank you.
"Zoe Kanu true, some people are better than another, but, it doesn’t mean that you have to TREAT them different."
And we all end up in the grave.
Every needs to be treated equally except Derrick 😂
"The gender spectrum is at balance. Everyone is happy. Just now, feminists are starting to infringe on our rights, but othereise we are fine with u guys being equal"
"Nope, there are some spheres of life where equality is unattainable. Some tasks are made for women while some are made for men. Accept those differences and move ahead."
 @heavenascended  so you want to stay superior to woman but woman cannot be superior to man? Sorry iam no understanding.
 @siu281  just cause some tasks are better done by a gender doesn't mean we arent equal?...but I dont understand what these tasks are? Heavy lifting? Many woman can actually lift pretty well. Taking care of children? Well many men are actually pretty nurturing?
" @AlexanderMarchesaine  Biologically, men are better suited for heavylifting and women are better suited to nuture children. Obviously there's exceptions but if I needed heavy stuff to be moved, I'll more likely find a big man and if I need a babysitter, I'll more likely find a woman to do so."
 @zoezoe8024  dont compare people no one is perfect
" @zoezoe8024   in certain areas, yes . But this inequality should not be due to gender or race"
"Except Derrick, he can just scuttle back to the hole from whence he came."
Expect Shrek
Tanicha Amparo No gender is superior to the other. The moment we all realize that we can be better off and stop the ridiculous back and forth fighting. Women and men can be alike in every way except biologically.
" @zoezoe8024  so who's ""better"""
"tell that to the misogynists
You're one of the men who want to dismiss Feminism in the acts of ""everyone matters"" like that's the whole point of feminism for EQUALITY ‼️"
 @heavenascended  nah bruh. You're just misinformed
 @BC-vz5xq  it's not. Do your research
 @filipmizenko7524  It's a human thing. It doesn't necessarily always have to be bad
 @abigailmarughu3403  someone
I like you tubers because it’s the opposite of what the government wants
"not really. the other mra's agreed with him on most stuff. even zach, the most ""reasonable"" mra, believed agreed with him"
​ @regisglass5464  was he wrong?
"​ @regisglass5464 , they don't. Feminism is one of the main reasons for men's issues."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's actually true, feminism saying both parents are equal is the reason MRAs then say men are inherently worse parents"
​ @regisglass5464  why aren't women better caregivers? Give your reasons.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  why do you believe men are simply worse parents?
"​ @regisglass5464 not worse parents. Why do women take up care positions than men do?

Being a better caregiver doesn't mean being a better parent. Fathers and mothers have different roles."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and what roles do mothers and fathers have that you attempt to simultaneously state men are and are not worse parents? Is the role of men to only give money to the family, ie, not be a parent?"
​ @regisglass5464  why does this bother you so much?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  that's odd. Why do you now essentially ask me why an issue presented by MRAs is pertinent? Shouldn't it bother you?
"​ @regisglass5464 , why would it bother me?

You seem really bothered by the MRAs."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""why would it bother me?""
exactly, thank you for thus showing why only feminists help people"
" @DavidW-ng5zv   ""why would it bother me?""
again, thank you for showing why only feminists help people"
"@DavidW-ng5zv   ""why would it bother me?""
again, thank you for showing why only feminists help people"
"​ @regisglass5464 , what has feminism done for m en?"
"@DavidW-ng5zv   ""why would it bother me?""
again, thank you for showing why only feminists help people"
What is an incel??
Ivan Stalkerson OH YEAH
No joke I thought Derrick was a woman
Tbh that would be awesome
Hugely overlooked.
that's what i was think too!!
"ignore well sure a male feminist but a female men’s rights activist???!?!? 
That can’t be a thing"
"Woman can't be mras and men can't be feminist, they can be allies. But if you aren't the sex it's not the same."
" @anaescobar8746  yeah, there are. I can consider myself one because it should be compatible w feminism"
 @aradiamegido7040  It's not the same but it can still happen
Ana Escobar I am
Tru dat
Well you arent wrong
I think Zach just might be misguided. He probably hasn’t educated himself and thinks feminism means he won’t get his problems fixed. He needs to learn some things about feminism.
 @marieremelie6716  zach is sound
Zachs the only one I can kind of respect
"I don't necessarily agree with Zach so it is difficult to feel empathy or something similar for him. But I think his misogynistic thoughts are more related to outright misinformation rather than deep hatred or annoyance for women.  Like for example he didn't know what they meant when they said toxic masculinity, he said he didn't believe in toxic masculinity but he didn't even know what it was. 
That does not justify the rest but I think it is very different from what Derrick expresses"
 @marieremelie6716  He confusing Feminists with Feminazis
"Manners is different than the actual topic for discussion. Tbh, I think everyone in the comments needs to get some manners, because everyone is just hating like nobody's business. Why don't we actually listen instead of tearing people apart."
 @danielhart7156  true
" @Mehrabnahid  Daniel is trying to act all diplomatic and peace loving right now, but I've seen some of his replies and they don't exactly reflect what he's trying to get across. He's just virtue signaling right now. In one of his replies he said all feminists are clowns who don't deserve spaces to voice their opinions."
 @Mehrabnahid  I think the biggest problem with todays feminism is that feminists (majority of women) are defining what it means to be a man and what it means to be masculine. His points aren't necesarily wrong; women and men are different and they both have some advantages and some disadvantages. Where the problem lies with me is every single feminist media that I have seen (an article or a yt video for e.g.) is not even mentioning anything about women having priviledge. IDK thats my point of view feel free to change my mind
derrick’s secret account
she has a name
 @rxmiry wrd
He was on point. I would've laughed even harder if I was there. Those girls sounded pathetic
Larrie!
 @80for80  u sound like derrick 2.0
 @80for80  derrick is that u
 @beckyzhong  😉
 @cbkoc1997  🤷🏽‍♂️
" @80for80  They actlly respected the other men's arguments while derrick came w comparing women w children and saying how when women had no rights and had to marry for money, they were happier. Theres a reason why u relate to him"
"To be fair, in my everyday life I have an instinctual problem to smile or chuckle when I get the slightest bit nervous. I'm not saying that's definitely what happened to him, but there's a chance"
 @80for80  were they pathetic for asking for basic human rights and talking openly about their trauma
 @80for80  derrick??
He was coping!
 @80for80  dang I didn't know Derrick had a son
"Ik, they didn't even have to tell their names and I already knew who everyone was hating on."
"Great example how toxic masculinity can also be perpetuated by women. Also, it absolutely is other men putting down men for being emotional."
​ @somethingcomedy9437  nope.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  are you gonna give proof or just 'nuh-uh' me? I think you just don't understand what toxic masculinity is.
Women do purposefully stay away from him 🤮
"he probably had bad luck with women, leading to him hating women because ""WoMeN aRe AlL tHe SaMe!!1!"""
" @Donald_Trump_2024  ""bad luck""
Guys, it's obvious that the dude is not physically attractive, and he also isn't charismatic. I'll bet that all women in his life are in fact the same, when it comes to him. None of them like him.
He's quite unlikable, but he's right. He's an incel, and he acknowledges it. It doesn't require ""bad luck"" for things to be and stay that way for him."
" @onceortwice_  he repulses women... ""repels""? shrugs Same difference"
 @razycrandomgirl  huh
"""I'm homeless but I have a house"""
im wet but that doesnt mean i've been in water
He said he was labeled as an incel not admitting that he was one
"he should have said ""I'm an incel and women laugh at my face a lot""."
do incels hate women?
" @sonofaquack6987  they often do 
but the definition of an incel doesnt specify that they do"
It doesn't mean that...
"Yeah well, incel basically means being celibate involuntarily. There’s two words that better fit the idea of hating women and that is sexism or misogyny."
 @manu-nz7vc  Of course you could be wet with any liquid.
 @hydrolito  -_-
"When you think about it, if this third wave feminism wasn't a thing, Alyesha would never have gone through what she did, a traditional society would not tolerate that."
The shallow comments towards Derrick thinking it disproves what he said…
Feminism just call it being a Karen
I think Derrick is deeply insecure and treats women as inferiors to make himself feel powerful. That’s why people who belittle others often have low self esteem; they gain their self-gratification off denigrating/belittling others in a pretentious manner.
Why are women trying to say what is toxic for men to do?
“I think toxic masculinity is real” literally everyone: Derrick
"Familie is important, not Idiologie"
DEFINE TOXIC MASCULINITY PLEASE
Derrick completely destroyed this episode.
Everyone wants equal rights until the cruise ship starts to sink…..
The guys lost me at the first question 😂
"derrick: "" i wouldn't be friends with a woman.""
also derrick:  ""finding a women is so hard these days."""
"I will not share my own, personal view of any controversial topic. What I will do, however, is watch with both disappointment in humanity and amusement as others attempt to tear each other down with their own opinions, political beliefs, etc."
derrick actively sees and treats women as inferior and still wonders why he's a virgin. ok bud
"19:32  that question was on point, and i don't even think the girls got it."
Should do a reboot but have fresh and fit on the show
K asam for men and women having equal rights.
"""She's my mom, I love her"" and ""I'm an incel"" do not belong even remotely close together"
"To me this was more like men’s rights vs women’s rights. It didn’t really feel like feminism, but idk.

Then there’s Derrick, who none of us like or agree with."
I would like if they had male feminists and female male activists. We could probably get more insight.
Lmao
Wanting women's rights is being a Karen?
" @CeeC_230 feminism now is just women empowerment, not really fighting for women’s rights. 50 years ago and it’s another story"
 @ely9735   There’s still countries were women have no rights at all though.
 @CeeC_230  agreed but i’m talking about the western world.
"I think he honestly was trolling, after listening to these females I would have"
" @eveningswan4491  nah, the entire incel is like him. it's sadly not a joke"
maybe because women arent the exact same as men in everything
He's the poster child for incels
Yeah hes a disgrace to low self esteem people
"Literally the definition of what he called himself, an “incel’. Look it up, its sad and disturbing."
It isn't real.
" @cancelled_user  your'e gonna sit here and tell me that all those terms are sexist... they aren't used to degrade men they're just definitions of things that not all men do sometimes. And yes men are privileged, they aren't free of oppression of course but lets take the general straight white male. He has privileges other races, genders, and sexualities don't have. Now i will say he is oppressed in some areas like emotion and masculinity but he is no where near as oppressed as all the other minorities."
 @cancelled_user  Kyle you are not oppressed because a women said you mansplain
 @cancelled_user  mansplaining is a thing though 🤡🤡🤡🤡
" @cancelled_user  are you talking about woman in third world countries? cause they surely don't have that. I believe in at least my country by law, women and men = equal but by society.....just look at how people judge  a 33 yo mom of a 5 so going out on a Saturday night with hubby at home.and a dad of the same age with a 5yo kid going out. they surely judge the mother more like she should only be the parent at home"
IKRR and also a woman isn't gonna be your partner the second you snap your fingers. she has to be your friend first. it's like wanting to run before you can walk. the dude pissed me off so much i legit had to take a 5 minute break from youtube to calm myself down in order to entertain myself ✨peacefully✨
" @gansz_lol  mansplaining is not a thing. That's just a sexist term used for something that both men and women and it happens to everyone, but feminism wants to try and paint it as a male only thing used to oppress women."
" @lucyheadings2073  ""but he is no where near as oppressed as all the other minorities."" - Yet there are privileges to all those other 'minorities' as well but no one likes to talk about those."
 @Eseerrowez  hahaha factual point. You home to your wife bro. I bet you feel males are oppressed too.
 @gansz_lol  Still waiting for an actual counter by you instead of failed attempts of ad hom fallacies to try and discredit someone. Or are facts just really hard and triggering for you?
 @Eseerrowez  lol no. It's just funny to me how you just @ random people on a 2 yo video looking for beef. Like are you a rapper???
literally me rn
Xeta he isn’t though that’s the sad part
at least he's putting himself out there. He's not gonna be a virgin for longer lol.
Hahi
What do you think feminism is?
That would have been amazing to watch lol
Do those exist?
" @tda8649  They do, but I think there are far less female MRAS than male feminists."
" @tda8649  believe it or not, yes"
I think that would have been more interesting too because I personally believe that everyone does have a bias of some sort to try to support their own gender. So having the opposite gender supporting each other aka having a male feminist (I know feminism isn't  specifically supporting women) and a female male activist would have been neat too.
Angry Egalitarian that’s fax. The two things they talk about are the past and the wage gap that has been debunked countless times. And sometimes education which simply does exist
"Light Wing it mostly is. Feminism has fem which in gender is only a root for feminine and female. Some feminists want equality, others want extra benefit, and some just hate men"
I want to see this !!!
The DestrOyer A most men are shamed into being feminists. Try asking a guy if he’s a feminist in a group conversation.
2 words affirmative action
"The video was for the women to express their views while didn’t get to talk much, anytime one the guy expressed their views they would get interrupted 🤦🏽‍♂️"
"The feminists at the sides and Derrick are trifling 😂😂😂
Only Kursat, Zach and the middle feminist really held it."
Zach and Kursat are W
"The video starts with a woman saying ""women don't need to be shepherd"" and then on the very first question, the 3rd women walks up just because the other 2 woman walked up 😂😂😂😂"
"That intersectional white feminist was stereotype of cancerous 3rd wave toxicity, but derick was so incompetent & immature in argument, all negative focus was on him.
When he opens his moth I was 🤦‍♂."
This videos such a hard watch everytime one of the men ask them to explain they instantly get defensive and have a attitude and half the time they’re asking for an explanation they’re saying please and still catching an issue like for what
Derrick needs a therapist. Zach is cool tho
@9:10 Damn I ain't gonna live long. Never been honest with the most important person in my life. Go a week at a time without touching another person sometimes. And only had one relationship in 30 years that lasted 3 months.....So I guess I'll be dead by 40
"“i just hope you weren’t comparing women to children”,yikes"
"@10:59 
Asking someone for a phone number doesn't make them in danger... LMFAO 😂"
22:04 Bro just had a Jesse Lee Peterson moment  💀💀
16:52  your little reaserched opinion 😂😂
What’s annoying is how they had Derrick represent the men’s rights activists. I wouldn’t say I’m a men’s right activist but I will say that Derrick did not represent their community well. A majority of men’s and women’s activists just want equal rights.
they should’ve brought kurtis conner for one of the feminists
12:54 that string of likes hurt me 💀
"Men and women might have differences but 
we shouldn't be only limited to our norms and roles
we should be able to choose any careers we want, hobbies we want or even toys we want as a kid without facing any sexism.
It's all about giving both sexes choises they want outside of their norms.
It's not about making stem fields 50/50 men/women."
Every sound Derrick exudes makes every muscle in my body cringe
derrick is entertaining 😂
"me: sees derrick ""this dude looks like an incel""
derrick: ""i'm also known as an incel""
me: surprised pikachu face"
I think she might of just been a little behind? She seemed to be thinking of something in the moment when the others were walking over to the stools.
" @SamExceptNotSam  she looked like she clearly wasn't going to go, but after both went, she followed."
" @J040PL7  considering the question that was asked at the time I would believe she was just lost in thought. But I wouldn’t know what was going through her head at the time. Maybe she was following the others, or maybe she wasn’t."
" @SamExceptNotSam  she was indecisive in her thoughts and made her decision based on group thinking, like a sheep..."
 @J040PL7  perhaps. I’m just saying that neither of us would know what she was thinking in the moment.
That's the issue. All the eyes were on Derrick being a fool when Aleysha and the other girl were ignorant af.
"I loved how the girl feels attacked by the mens movement and ask why there's a need of that movement. 
Imagine if they pingpong that question and asked her why there's a need of feminism movement. 
They would go monkey nuts"
i skipped every time derrick spoke he made 0 sense-
Rainy Zhu yet Derrick made more sense than all the women on here
" @gawddayum6405  bruh he was like im an incel, and ""we'll all do well if we travel back in time"" in front of bLACK WOMEN i was like omg the second hand embarrassment"
 @gawddayum6405  everyone were cringing when he spoke
Rainy Zhu ok buddy 👌🏾😂
 @gawddayum6405  the clownery i-
Malek Whitlow huh? No he didn’t-
vladimir putin so stereotypical
vladimir putin bigot
@vladimir putin Who hurt you?
 @vladimirputin2234  deadass thought you were Derrick for a sec
Kirstin Opal my thoughts exactly
 @vladimirputin2234  why are watching woman being hurt casually and not doing anything
 @notsojolly6550  nobody but I got more likes on my post then yours so more people agree with me
 @katecastro752  because they aren't being hurt if someone isn't phisically abusing them and brushing against someone's arm isn't that and I have seen a woman. In a public mall start calling out RAPE because a man bumped into her walking in a elevator
 @vladimirputin2234  I agree with u my comrad
@Flora Derner no I agree 100% and my first comment was basically a joke
 @AnPham-gr1si  that's so old
 @exohexoh3948  and that's a threat I'm reporting you just like a woman would do
" @vladimirputin2234  Um you do know people can be emotionally hurt right? Aka depression, Anxiety, etc."
 @hanalovesyt7452  yeah but not everybody
really? damn I'm down. Try and take me down. @exohexoh3948 
 @vladimirputin2234  not a threat but an observation. Would be happy to meet up if we can film it 🤷‍♀️ pm me
 @exohexoh3948  you probably live in a democratic state since your a feminist and you wouldn't won't to meet up
 @vladimirputin2234  the offer's there little one.
" @vladimirputin2234  actually, I'd be going to jail because it's illegal for me to engage in anything outside of a legitimate match. For you, I'll make an exception."
 @exohexoh3948  you got an Instagram where I can pm
 @exohexoh3948  yeah u ain't got anything
" @vladimirputin2234  apologies for working. Something I'm sure you know nothing abouy. 
You can PM me on YouTube."
 @exohexoh3948  yeah I know about it but your probably not doing actually work
 @exohexoh3948  you can't pm on YouTube Moro
 @exohexoh3948  😂 who said I am scared of a woman I get notifications I am scared of no woman I'm a freaking boxer
 @vladimirputin2234  what a coincidence! What's your club?
 @vladimirputin2234  You can email it and we can have a regulated match... it will be filmed and posted.
 @vladimirputin2234  bruh you need to learn to chill
 @exohexoh3948  Douglasville boxing club
 @jasoncg2956  hey guess what nobody asked u to talk
 @exohexoh3948  were talking about a male boxer who has been boxing for 7 years against you who thinks you can beat a man who is definitely stronger than you no doubt cause I'm pretty sure you don't bench 310
" @vladimirputin2234  I know the one. Owned by fast Eddie yeah? Email me, let's sort it out. I'm smarter than to let out my capabilities but your bench press abilities don't really concern me at all."
" @vladimirputin2234  *waste.
You're not even a full grown man are you? How disappointing.
I'm interstate but I know ""Your club"" very, very well and I travel for matches a lot anyway so would happily make the trip if you'd let me film it. Just email me. I don't see what a big, strong 310 bench pressing man like yourself is so afraid of. All I'm doing is giving you an opportunity to prove your theory."
Not going to lie Derrick was pretty sexist the other 2 were chill
Yea the guy in the grey for sure was respectful and asking questions and trying to understand. Derrick was just trying to get a reaction
C0nnMaN92 exactly
Wheres_Sandiego yup exactly
 @conner7168  Explain how he was sexist
He compared women to children in that they needed to be protected where as the other two were just wondering the others views
"They have equal rights, And derrick made a good statement. People just don't understand derrick because feminist get into their heads."
" @conner7168  yeah he compared women to children in a good way, He didn't say ""women are immature"" or anything. Females just want derrick gone because he's making a good point"
"Honestly, why would they get a youtuber. Out of all people"
What do u mean a good way?
Jack Jack Through The SpaceShip! Yeah I know what he was trying to say but he worded it kinda poorly
I like derrick btw eveeyone is sexist and racist in a way my dad would love derrick cause he fuckin makes sense its about putting the point across
He definitely represents men’s rights activists well.
Angry Egalitarian 💀
Denise Cabral so what do the other two guys represent? Just cause one percent of a group did something bad shouldn’t mean you have to punish the other 99%.
Mark remember to eat your cereal
"They had extremes of both Derrick was very traditional and that was the point, both women on the end were quite extreme in their splitting of men. The Uni grad on the end was like Men have to fix this and its about men etc.
The other women was all about what men do to hurt women etc.
Realstically a good balance is between the middle woman and the two end men.

The guy who listens is perfect, the guy with facts and research is good to make sure he knows, then the woman is good because she knows the general overall disadvantages it is to be a woman without also have some negative bias towards men like the other two do."
I like foreign European dude
k i k i I WAS LITERALLY THINKING THAT and honestly just having a man on the feminist side would’ve been great in general but god kurtis would’ve thrown hands with that incel
YESSS
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO GREAT!
Mahn!kurtis is everywhere❤...I would love if dean was on the other side too..😂😂
k i k i YESSS!
They should've invited Vaush
k i k i he should’ve been in the Lesbian video 😂
hello fellow Kurtistown members ✨
Another kurtis town citizen I see 😳😌
 @mizaashique6157  Dean is not really a good advocate anymore...
FACTS
k i k i dude yes omg I love you 💯% agree with that
 @wells346  yeah...but It would be so much fun to watch kurtis kick his ass🤭
They should of had Karen Straughn she is one of the be MRA or Erin Pizzey who is another great MRA.
"Matthew, me too."
Literally though....
What a brave opinion.
SAME BRU LIKE THIS MAN LOOKS AND ACTS LIKE A POTENTIAL SHOOTER
It matches his jacket too
There is a video about incel and he is in it
" @lentzdadjentlaman1348  

where

edit: nevermind found it"
LITERALY.
"He's got that Comic Book Guy look.   Dude needs to get some exercise, cut that hair, and get some pants.  He's too young to be that much of a Schlub.  As far as the three women, they will be unwillingly single for life and popping antianxiety and antidepressants meds everyday.  Avoid at all costs"
sean grant And I'm not shallow or based EVERYTHING off his looks. I rarely actually based anything off his looks. His looks is just an extra to it. I based pretty much everything on his way of thinking and how he sees women as close as animals.
"I liked how zach was actually trying to create a bridge of mutual understanding. Derrick was trying so hard to make sense, but still made zero sense."
It’d be humorous in a twisted way if Derrick isn’t actually real and that he’s just an actor these guys hired to make everyone mad
jubilee knew what they were doing when they let derrick join the discussion.
"Can't believe that guy says ""I'm an Incel"" as his personality trait"
Derrick may have been dropped on his head by that single mom.
"""I feel empathy for the other side.""
Derrick: waits for the other guys to start walking first"
"When you hear the phrase men's rights what comes to mind ?

Aggression"
"Derrick: yeah I feel empathy, FOR WOMEN BEING LOST.
I died"
“Why should women be taxed for buying tampons” lol and derrick also hating on girls for not getting a girlfriend
Derek looks like the guy in a movie who gets killed first
"Derrick showed up for the promo and nothing else. He not an MRA, he’s an incel."
If you re gonna invite someone like derrick for men you should invite a blue haired npc for women cmon
"Why wouldnt they get anyone else other than Derrick. Mimi was another that needed to be replaced tbh.

Derrick and Mimi need to check in with reality"
"""im an incel""

Yeah, we can tell lmao."
"Derrick: If I were  misogyny could I do this?: 
*has a mom*"
A f eminist (such as the ones in the video) are the last people I would ask for advice about being a m an/masculinity.
I felt awkward just watching Derrick handshake those women lol
I love how Derrick complained that it's hard to find girls when he's just like
"derrick: toxic masculinity does not exist 
also derrick: tells a story literally describing how toxic masculinity works"
The one with the nose ring is so emotional like Kursat women are
"If Derrick uses 4chan,Reddit,Discord or all of these, he is real.
Sadly, there are people like this and it was hard for me to believe it."
" @thefabulousoogabooga6410  I know people like this are real and everywhere, especially on those particular apps because they're all anonymous.

That being said, I was just referring to the video in and of itself, that they got a guy who'd look and act like a stereotypical incel just to mess with everyone."
@Maria Bendel bro I'm sorry about that. Some people may change so I guess there is hope
Sadly there are millions of Derrick they ALL hang out on ifunny.
 @thefabulousoogabooga6410  I'd say hes all of those and ifunny....ifunny is like 99% derricks
" @starchaser1437  Oh shoot, forgot to add that one on the list, smh"
I wish tho
let's hope
I genuinely was considering that he might be an actor
so true!!
And I'm here for it
LMFAOOOOO
 @Febreezy  why
CRYYYINNGG LMAOO
UT Jason because it’s funny
He said as if it's something to be proud of 💀
"That’s shameful and embarrassing to admit. It’s really something you hide, instead of boast over lol"
well I'm an incel. not reactionary incel though
" @calculuslover2078  
I hope you find someone who loves you"
 @idrk1507  derrick is just a genius. Who will call him an incel if he already called himself like that
exactly
 @magoomjey2287  everyone will still call him that
im dead 😂😂
AHHHHH STOP IM ON A PLANE AND EVERYONE IS SLEEPING HDJDJ
"Yes, just yes."
How does his mom tolerate him?
you know he comitted suicide
 @skelt6578  are you serious?? Where did you find out?
If only he was a mentally stronger female
 @graciecepeda6691  airplane mode
 @heeheeheehee7655  why so toxic? seems wrong towards someone who attempted suicide.
 @imreadyt0g0h0me  thanks for telling me
i dont really feel empathy sooooo im happy i wasnt there XD
dan so you’re a sociopath or psychopath
 @ara-nv4dj  haha he definitely is
 @ara-nv4dj  that depends on my mood
dan so yes
Spenduck Games lol it was funny don’t lie
Diana Islamova I like ur profile pic
"In video I was waiting for Derricks part because I knew he is going say something hilarious 😂😂😂, I dont know in which world he is living."
"What does he even mean by that?? Lost how? Probably from god considering how he wanted to ""go back to the past"" the way that black girl looked at him was SENDING me 😭😭😭 like ""hello? Im a black woman. The LAST thing I wanna do is go back to the past"""
 @Mythril  ikr like what world is he living in? the past sucked like the dude probly wouldebt of even survived back then lol
Literally lmao
Derrick asking that then saying he very disliked women
Fax
"Just about everything has taxes. You should be more concerned about where that tax money is going because it’s not going to anything useful, or just ending up in the pockets of corrupt politicians- who are also the ones taxing things in the first place."
He is OBVIOUSLY gonna die alone and virgin on his 40s
" @lucifernazaedi  No it’s fucked up that tampons and pads are taxed as luxury items especially bc there is nothing luxurious about them. Usually states make exceptions for non-luxury items meaning those items are a necessity, pads and tampons are a necessity so they should be taxed accordingly (which means they shouldn’t be taxed if that was unclear)."
 @reece5667  Why do you think I said you should be more concerned about that tax money and who is taxing them? I wasn't saying that it was acceptable. Reread my comment because you misunderstood it.
" @lucifernazaedi  Hmmmm I don’t think I did, taxes pay for the maintenance of public property. Some of it does end up in corrupt politicians pockets but that’s not the only place it goes. The issue I had with you was that you’re rude bc you tried to derail the conversation about how incredibly unfair the taxation of women’s feminine hygiene products is. Which was the main focus of my comment and the og commenter."
" @reece5667  Actually.. I was being civil. And no, I was not trying to derail the conversation at all. I understand it is an issue. I never said it was okay."
Derek isn’t black
He makes Eugene from The Walking Dead look like Rambo.
Heehee Kozmnavt.
"Nah he looks like the doof who somehow survived everything but got traumatized so now we're all supposed to like him cause he's ""changed"""
"No, he’s the guy picking off the protagonists."
Why?
 @regisglass5464   why not
"Dont need the blue hair, feminists always out themselves in seconds if you just let them talk. Just like they all did here."
Lol yeah he didn't need to say that. It was obvious from the start
Go derrick woohoo😎👍
What's an incel?
" @gutentag9190  involuntary celibate 
Celibate means staying aways from sex"
 @aarohanyt7374  I didn't know that
"literally the first thing i thought when i saw him was ""incel"""
ALL THE TIME
*misogynist
I think it’s better if you remove the ‘a’ so it reads: ‘if I were misogyny’
" @fredabriskman958  Thankyou for telling me, english is not my first language :)"
"ok so derrick isnt a mysognist, he says he believes that they aren't equal but neither one is better, what he does believe is that one is weaker (physically) and is talking about protecting woman in the sense of chivalry which is seen as a positive trait in men. im not saying I agree with all his veiws and beliefs, but I just thing you are miss understanding him, which I blame no one for bc he kinda doesnt really speak all that well"
 @ubaihayat6265  he sees us as objects that he’s entitled to.. yes he is
 @Penguinstudios123  where does he say that?
 @ubaihayat6265  in every single word he said
" @tanianeira9532  i ment timestamp, get that and ill retract my comment and say I was wrong"
 @ubaihayat6265  watch the video again it’s the whole video
Same! The producers shouldn't've made them do it
Bellatrix Black why does that matter?
I wouldn't have shaken his hand
Ol' boy's palms were sweating 😂
"He literally said ""i would never be friends with a woman soooo..."" Why is he complaining"
"well by looks alone, he's already going to have a hard time but then he opens up his mouth and its a sure bet😅"
 @lotusgrl444  He actually had a glow up and doesn't identify as an incel anymore. Nice to know some people change
"Humans are toxic not just ""males"".
Any human can be good or bad irrespective of their gender.
There is no role of gender in toxicity. 
Both genders can be toxic as well as gentle.
So, If a human is toxic then INSTEAD of blaming his/her gender, we should blame that PARTICULAR toxic PERSON irrespective of gender."
" @asg8813  but the whole point to toxic masculinity is that men ate specifically raised to shun emotions that aren't anger or happiness. women are so emotional open because we, usually, are raised different. men, because of this, are more toxic because they just don't know how to properly handle their feelings."
" @asg8813  ask toxic masculinity doesn't ONLY regard emotions. men are seen as big, tough, and strong. when men do things that aren't considered that (i.e. wear skirts, wearing purses, crying, etc) they're shunned and looked down upon by OTHER MEN. toxic masculinity is real, whether you know it or not. 🤷🏽‍♀️"
"Mam both genders can be toxic as well as gentle. 
If a person is toxic then please blame that PARTICULAR person, not his/her gender. 
And yes i am not denying that toxic males does not exist, i believe that toxic people exist not toxic gender."
" @oinkoink8333   when a man wear makeup or wear skirts then he is teased by women too, not just by other men. 
Example when harry styles wore skirt, then many women were also teasing him badly."
 @asg8813  true
" @anand3280  as someone whose a fan of harry styles and his also a female. the vast majority of his fans absolutely loved it. it was random MEN that weighed in in the topic, called it ""unmanly"", and then ran with it so..."
" @swaroop2518  the whole point of toxic masculinity is that MEN are RAISED in a way that makes them emotionally unavailable, even going so far as the shun emotions away. they always have to be the ""tough"" guy but women aren't seen as that. they're nourishing and mother-like which makes for an abundant of emotions availability.  because men are raised differently, they have harder time processing emotions to which toxic masculinity derives from. both men and women CAN be toxic but men are RAISED in a way that makes it NORMAL for them to be toxic."
" @oinkoink8333  yes i agree that many people do raise men in such tough guy way, but its bad for men themselves and even many mothers also believe in that.
And i have seen that many many women are also teasing harry styles in the show badly. 
So many women aslo believe in gender roles."
" @oinkoink8333    mam i have seen some interviews and shows in which some women are also teasing him badly. 
You are saying that only men do such things and women are completely innocent everytime. 
Like i said both genders can be wrong and right at multiple places."
 @oinkoink8333  men have higher testosterone which cause more anger while women have more estrogen which makes them more emotional.
" @ljllob4740  sure but genatics can always be changed. there are feminine men and openly emotional ones that express their feelings healthily. if you're denying that most men are brought up in a less aggressive, less emotionally valued way..... you might wanna rethink some things"
 @oinkoink8333  it isn’t about genetics it’s about how mentally and physically are bodies are different like a said
 @oinkoink8333  and what do you mean genetics can change that’s only physical not mental which has nothing to do with anger or emotions.
" @ljllob4740  there are plenty of men who are able to handle their emotions and think rationally despite ""there bodies being different"" so... i don't rlly understand to your point. toxic masculinity is brought up by how a man is raised into being emotionally shamed and forced to be ""the tough guy""."
 @oinkoink8333  and what’s wrong with being a tough guy as long as you don’t beat women up without tough guys you wouldn’t be on this planet
 @oinkoink8333  their will always be a minority who will have lower testosterone like I explained that’s why the minority are more feminine or are you going to ignore my points and keep repeating yours
“Toxic masculinity” doesn’t exist
" @oinkoink8333   @savannah sablan    mam i have seen some interviews and shows in which some women are also teasing him badly. 
You are saying that only men do such things and women are completely innocent everytime. 
Like i said both genders can be wrong and right at multiple places."
 @asg8813  yes
" @oinkoink8333  mam even women believes in gender roles.
And when harry styles applied makup or wore dress then many women also laughed and teased him.
Also men are also teased by many women on appliying makup or showing emotions along with men."
 @anand3280  yes bro
Yes! I wish someone called him out on that!
" @oinkoink8333   see don't only blame men because many women also believes in patriarchy, mysoginy and misandry. 
In harry styles case, go and see that many women are also teasing him for not being man enough. 
And many women also believes that man should be strong and tough.
So women also put down men for showing emotions not just men."
When he said where and how did it come from men she should have explained how toxic masculinity misogony and feminism effect these biases especially when its saying men are stronger and this and that thats why there are court biases because we label women and men with these different traits
"Derek: ""but i wouldn't be friends with a woman""

Yall im crying"
"If ya’ll could stop cutting the vids, in particular when one side is making a point, and just release the whole debate. That would be great."
"He was so annoying and I don’t even need to say his name, you already know"
They should get men from different type of environments. Cause I got a lot I could of said
I feel like Bea and Zach had the most intelligent conversations.
"Derek doesn’t just have a punchable face, he has a beatupable aura"
This the most uncomfortable conversation ever recorded
It’s really fkin hilarious how Derrick laughs after everything he says just like he thinks everyone agrees with him
"telling a group of strangers that you are not having sex is so odd. imagine if someone sat down and said “my name is brad, i’m a political activist, and i have sex frequently.”"
"I am a man and I do not approve of Derrick, he said a man should not cry over a cut but he would probably😂😂😂😂"
19:20 in childhood matriarchy can be problem because girls are often treated like princesses
I'm trying really hard to see both sides to this and learn from it but every time Derek opens his mouth I need to pause the video and calm myself down for a few moments lmao
"I would've loved to hear a one-on-one between Zach and Bea, they really were so genuinely trying to understand one another!"
It's not like all women sat at a table and said we're gonna put all these responsibilities on men and were gonna get our kids when we divorce our husbands when women weren't even allowed to speak unless spoken to a certain times.
“You were very articulate” like he was surprised 🙄
"I like Zach, even though I don’t agree with his opinions and think that they are incorrect, I like how he is at least is a little respectful of their opinions"
Can someone put time stamps that allow me to just skip every time Derrick speaks?
"O by the way to the lady mimi, i think by now all people who want their voice to be heared must know to bring facts to a debate or discussion. 
You can't say i know there are organisations out there that do x, y & z but  you can't name one, so how do you know then?....... what makes your knowledge that they exist more superior to the person you are debating who is literally quoting the reseached fact ?...................and to show that she was triggered she refered to his researched info as ""your little...""           things you say when you want to devalue someone or their views"
bro derrick is that one guy who is all ego with no real knowledge to back that up
Men are stronger.
And he wonders why he's an incel. How can you have a romantic relationship with a woman if you can't even be friends with one?
His mom should’ve got him a sister
Riley Hanlon 👀！
"> i wouldnt be friends with a woman
> i'm an involuntary celibate

Should we tell him? Or just let him have the comfort of thinking that the absence of female friends is actually his choice and not the result of his ugly, condescending personality?"
"Just to be clear, I don’t agree with Derek on many of his points. I don’t think he represents the Men’s Rights position very well. But I happen to understand what he’s trying to convey on this point. Ultimately, it depends what you mean by friendship. If your definition of friendship is broader, then yes. Women and men can hang out time to time without there being anything sexual. However, if your definition of true friendship is more narrow (like mine), then it’s more unlikely. That doesn’t mean that it can’t happen. However, really deep non sexual relationships between men and women are rare. And the more emotionally profound the relationship gets, the more unlikely it will become. It’s very difficult for men to become friends with women without there being some sort of sexual component that they ultimately crave. This can happen for women as well. But I’ve seen it happen to nearly all of my friends (myself included) as well as just random guys that I’ve talked to in passing. If there is no sexual reciprocity on that front, it becomes impossible to rectify the friendship without prolonged separation and a redefinition of the relationship. You can’t reverse sexual attraction without distance. But the way, this only applies to straight women and straight men. It’s a completely different story otherwise. I actually am curious: to any straight women who are reading this, can you point to a really strong friendship you have with a straight dude where you don’t think that dude is sexually attracted to you?"
" @thegiftedteacher  I absolutely can. One of my dearest friend is a straight male, and I'm a straight female. He's been there during some of my darkest moments and knows things about me that nobody else does. It's only one example, but I have multiple completely platonic friendship with males. I only have one female friend and she isn't even my best friend. I agree that sometimes sexual attraction can get in the way of a friendship, but that doesn't make it nearly as unusual or difficult as you think."
"Neheil That’s very interesting. I’m glad someone responded. Obviously, this is none of my business, so it’s perfectly fine if you don’t want to answer, but in the spirit of understanding the context a bit more, are he or you in a romantic relationship with another person? And if not in his case, do you know the reason why he is not interested in you romantically? Once again, I don’t want to pressure you to answer if you don’t want to because I realize this is definitely a personal question."
" @thegiftedteacher  we both are in very happy relationship at the moment. I definitely see your point here. Back when I was single tho, my best friend was a straight guy who was single as well and we had a 6 years long friendship. We were so close that a lot of people were indeed surprised that we were not in any way romantic, but our friendship was completely platonic. Unfortunately we made drastically different choices in life that separated us, but we still care for each other even if we don't have that friendship anymore. The affection that we had for each other was incredibly strong, but completely different from what love is and we both knew it. We shared a lot but were very different persons with very different lifestyles, a romantic or relationship between us would have been just impossible. I think that our friendship was so strong that it went beyond our genders and sexual preference. We were not ""a guy and a girl being friends"", just two people being friends and caring for each other, which I find really beautiful."
"Neheil Wow...That sounds quite profound. I definitely resonate with the statement it goes beyond “a guy and girl being friends.” Reminds me of a friendship I have. However, I would say this does seem like an exceptional friendship rather than the norm. The one thing I’m confused about was why the friendship split. Perhaps I misunderstand: are you still in touch or did you decide to amicably go separate ways without communication? I get the fact that you had different lifestyles and were very different people. But if the relationship was so deep, why did you not want to try to leap over that hurdle? Though that might just be a value judgment on my part. Once again, feel free not to answer if you’re not comfortable."
"Neheil You’re right, you can’t help everyone. But did you at one point believe you were going to be able to change him? Did you make it some sort of mission?"
" @thegiftedteacher  hey so i definitely understand your point on this, i really do. I cant say that i fully agree but you are weell spoken and put your argument well. Personally i beleive that non sexual relationships are a part of human nature, whether that be between same or different genders or sexes. I dont think that a man and a woman who are friends HAVE to have some deep seeded sexual desire for each other. I admit sexual feelings would be more commonly developed in that kind of feiendship but I think that it is 100% possible to be in a deep platonic relationship with a different gender."
" @thegiftedteacher  also to reply to your question about my male friends, I have 2 really close friends that are male. I can firmly say that we have openly talked about sex, and not once have they mentioned haveing sexual fantasies or desires or whatever towards me. That could be because im ugly to them or that they are focused on another girl but i really think its just because they veiw me as a friend."
" @lettylunasical4766  yes exactly, its like they skip the whole relationship aspect and just expect a sexual relarionship to be what all women want, and they think that degrading women is the way to get it.

Whack"
@Linn H those two statements put togetger is very funny to me lmao
 @SL-ul3yr  i mean i really wanna find his YouTube just to see if he is very open about his 'mens rights' activism.
What have u got against Zack??
Vafanapoli I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or not
Derrick?
Derrick my man
Vafanapoli derickk my dude
Amelia Singh I think he was being sarcastic
lek*inte Östberg ew
Dr Dumfuk yaaass
No it’s derrek. Zack was nice speaker
"Bea slayed this conversation. She summed up pretty much everything I feel about feminism and its necessity, and did so in a calm, yet firm manner. Very proud of her. Also I appreciate Kursat and Zach coming on here to share their perspective and hear what these women had to say, and vice versa."
And then there's Derek xD
"yeah, Zach and Bea came from, it felt, genuine places of understanding and empathy. Both of which are so much more valuable than ""this happens because x"" ""no it doesn't lol"""
Kursat also said intelligent things.
"The least opinionated* . Not sure much of this video included very much ""intelligence"""
 @bothi00  We don't talk about Derek.
" @m.m2594  They actually cut out a large chunk of what Kurzat had said, during the unedited discussion he was able to talk a lot more than was shown."
" @m.m2594  I can't disagree that Kursat is intelligent but Mimi was using logic. She's right, women do get custody most of the time because of the patriarchy in the court systems. I find it kind of hypocritical and the men's rights activists says it's ok and not bad to give women a care taker role and have men do the work then complain that men aren't punished as severely as women, live shorter lives, and doesn't get custody of kids. Like??? You are putting yourself in those positions. It's so frustrating seeing these young men complain about very valid men's issues but fail to realize they are often caused by patriarchy, their logic, and, funny enough, other men"
" @ihop2001 I'm sorry but I really can't really agree with the ""You are putting yourself in those positions"" and ""fail to realize"" statements. I believe they do have an understanding of all those things you said having a part of the problem, they just don't see it as what solely causes the issues and probably have different solutions to fix it beside getting rid of patriarchy since they still like what it mostly does. And the first part saying they're putting themselves in those situations is just... ignorant sounding."
" @cynthia4670  i didn't mean it literally, but when they say its not so bad having these genders roles where men must be together and women weaker, then they are just supporting that kind of system."
U. Do. Not Know. M yes
"Bea, Zach and Kursat made actual progress here."
Not A Cokehead same
Kursat was the most intelligent one there. He posted the whole uncut discussion on his channel. He brought 11 facts and statistics to the conversation but 90% of it was edited out.
HiByebtwn I agree. It’s a shame he didn’t talk more. He made a lot of good points like the falseness of the wage gap.
" @ihop2001  But see Derrick was the only one giving off the vibe that he wanted to keep women weaker, where as the other two it seemed more like they just feel like there are roles that are more fitted for a woman than a man and vise versa by nature, where I can defiantly agree that we do have different ways our body and minds grow to do what nature attended and that both are needed to have things running but that doesn't initially mean that either gender can't reach for more and have to stay just as that role. Derrick is the only one who wants it to stay as women being an objects of a man in a way and wanting women to stay in lifes ""attended"" purpose. So if anything only Derrick is supporting the idea where the other two are being misread for liking aspects of the idea."
" @cynthia4670  Ok I see where you are coming from, I agree and maybe I didn't have the best choice of wording. I don't think Kursat and Zach had any bad intentions, I guess it just kind of rubbed me the wrong way when Kursat was persistent on having the feminist give him an organization that fights for equal treatment in court, work place environment and other places when (at least in my personal opinion) they already explained that they are trying the fight system (the ""patriachy"") that (again, in my opinion) put men and women in those positions in the first place."
" @ihop2001  For that situation she said that she can confirm there are organizations that are fighting for equal rights for men but when asked to present one she got hostile mocking that he had research instead (even though data is very useful), where that made him believe their wasn't one like he thought or if their was one, that she's not really passionate about an organization like that anyways and the organization themselves are probably super small if she couldn't even name one. So it probably felt more empty that she claimed there are organizations out there when he's looked into it but again she really couldn't prove him wrong and expected that just saying there are organizations is enough to debunk him. And I think he only kept asking since if he didn't it would seem to be admitting she's right. But him asking a couple times shows that she doesn't have any acutal knowledge off of what he was talking about but only said she did so she could prove him wrong but in the end looked kind of foolish for fighting him for having research instead of giving an acutal response to his question."
"I’ve never bullied anyone in my life, but witnessing the monstrosity that is Derrick might just change that."
This comment is a toxic masculinity example
 @gossipandgrigio7200  wow.
 @dominiczibuda5232  ALERT ALERT WEE WOO WEE WOO
and we know damn well he'd cry
"People laugh for different reasons. Not always going to be with mocking intent. Sometimes it's a nervous reaction, and other times it's something else. Depends on the person"
sselemaNrM not Derrick lol
That's your interpretation. To me he laughs because he knows they disagree.
SerenityReceiver I guess it’s just because of his over-aggressive personality that I think that. Idk you might be right
"Pretty sure you feel that way because you don't like him. Not like the ""I don't want to fuck him"" kind of way, but I personally didn't see his laughing as ""yeah everyone thinks I'm a genius"" 

He laughed before stopping mid thought because he couldn't put his ideas together and got nervous. Also, considering his lack of interaction with women that he brandishes about, having three women stare at him as he says things against is probably super scary"
His laughing comes across as incredulous to me... like as of what he is saying is so obvious he can’t believe he has to even say it. It reads as very dismissive and full of himself imo.
"Andre_Pi^ that’s just the impression I get. You’re right, I don’t really like him, and that’s justified, because he’s obviously a very awful person. However, that doesn’t make my judgment on him invalid"
" @sharinettegonzalez23  We don't know that for sure. He is close minded and has his own views, but people really do laugh for different reasons, and it could turn into a reflex action for many. People laugh in the face of trauma, anxiety and other stressful situations all the times. And their intent is not to mock it. It's just how they deal with it"
Karellys97 you’re exactly right. I feel everyone is missing the point here
Sarah T omg THATS what I was trying to say. Thank you so much
" @jadecarlton6023  I'm not invalidating your judgment of his character. Just saying your interpretation of his actions is a bit unfair

Edit: of that particular action. Just the laughing and nothing else"
" @sselemaNrM  He should've known that laughing in this context and situation was just inappropriate and that it'd be bound to be misinterpreted IF he meant it the way you say he did. 

He literally laughed in the middle of serious talk. That's condescending and disrespectful. Just because he wasn't prepared for this doesn't excuse his behaviour."
"Andre_Pi^ his actions are up for any interpretation, and this is mine. Deal with it luv"
@andre your right bc like Derrick said he doesn’t have friendship with women so talking to another woman and sharing his take on things with a women is different for him bc I guess he is used to talking to men about this
literally did u see how visibly disgusted alyesha was by him.
​ @dedede5586 wait who said that?😭
⁠ @kpopistic6143 my thoughts exactly 😑
​@kpopistic6143 that's what an incel does/is
Yo
Probably because he is an actor reading a line.
​ @gamingprosforlife And what makes a femcel?
Yea that’s so weird
bro thinks those three feminists are hooked
​ @nocturnalrecluse1216 nothing because there is no such thing. You just made that up.
" @martymcfly5764  Made what up? That they're actors? If you hD astute observation, you'd notice it."
For realllll💦💦💦
Why would a man cry over anything that what women and gays do
" @KHEENGS  youre joking, right?"
 @htetnaing9597  why would I joke about that? The last time I cried was when I was a child. Men don’t cry
 @KHEENGS  well your family didnt raise you right lol im sorry for u
 @htetnaing9597  joking about what? You stop being a man the moment you stop being able to control trivia things like tears
" @KHEENGS  this is so sad, u should be able to express how u feel, no matter what your gender is, u are not more or less man for showing emotions, emotions are human, we all have them, no need to repress them<3"
 @Lele-ci4rv  you know I don't get society. One side would tell us to stop being emotional and the other side tells us to let our emotions free.
" @arthurswanson1755  you do you, but i think is sm more healthier to express how u feel and not repress it yk"
" @KHEENGS  men do. Men are entitled to basic emotions just like women. Human being feel. They have emotions and they are entitled to express them the way they want (obv not hurting others). If you do not like to let it out by crying that's fine, though it's not adviced its fine. But to generalise it by abiding to gender norms and saying ""men dont cry"" isnt it. Also gay men are men too."
 @Lele-ci4rv  there’s nothing sad about it I am proud of my heritage and customs that teaches men to you know be men. Why would a man cry? You lose all credibility when you start crying no matter the situations. Only women and children cry. Repressing your emotions makes you a man only women are led by emotions that’s why we pamper and care for them because they don’t have any control
guys I think we found Derrick.
" @KHEENGS  Dude, have you ever seen statistics regarding suicide distribution throughout the genders? Most of the people committing suicide are men, which your comment could potentially contribute towards. Not everyone has been fortunate enough in life to not be affected by trauma etc., so why would you hate on a healthy coping mechanism? Besides, why is it a ""sign of weakness"" in your eyes? First of all you cant always control it and it is just a reaction of the body, like when you sweat while bein stressed. Should a person that shows signs of being stressed also be ridiculed about it? Because according to that logic, that is something you can control (?). Pent up emotions could lead to serious consequences (eg the Elliot Roger case) and the situation isnt helped by people saying that rEaL mEn DonT cRY, because that standpoint automatically assumes that emotions are bad. You cant say you dont have them, because that is basically what defines humans. If expressing positive emotions (for example when you are proud of something or happy) is a good thing, then why should expressing negative emotions be a bad thing? What do you do when a loved one dies, you just shrug it off like it didnt matter to you or what? Besides, repressing emotions when youre with people close to you is a sign of being insecure and fearing that they wouldnt accept or discredit you, which you propegate further, creating an ideal that cant be reached by anyone, including you if youre honest with yourself. 
This comes from a person who doesnt cry, because I have been quite lucky, but many people arent as fortunate and/or may just want to express sadness etc that way and shouldnt be ridiculed because of that."
 @KHEENGS  pov: you get no ladies
 @vofvindication  yeah secret agent Derrdick
 @KHEENGS  Stop trolling
 @Smitology  trolling would imply that I care what you think
 @KHEENGS  my man you're based
 @KHEENGS  ok Derrick
 @KHEENGS  yep definitely trolling
 @KHEENGS  you are right my friend
 @Smitology  trolling who exactly?
 @KHEENGS  so sorry that toxic masculinity got to you this hard <3
 @KHEENGS  you’re like the textbook definition of toxic masculinity!!
 @mr.nobody4994  Is that supposed to be an insult or what? Because that’s a very high compliment I must say
 @KHEENGS  I agree with you men shouldn't cry .
Then blame it on his being raised by a woman 😶
"""men shouldnt cry"" why not? theyre human just like everyone else. and a ""sign of being gay""? is that a bad thing? and no wtf"
 @dolfy7591  yikez
 @georgechannel4778  yikes
 @SriElMejor  yikes
 @KHEENGS  it's a statement!! Take it as you wish!!
 @magk2524  hey man im stating my opinion here i was told from my school and parents men shouldn't cry
 @SriElMejor  that's wrong though. crying is good because if you keep your emotions bottled up you will become an angry and aggressive person most likely. and crying helps relieve yourself
 @magk2524  well like I said it is my opinion  and what I've been taught i haven't cried in about 5 years
 @mr.nobody4994  it’s a compliment then. Thanks I am very honored. Anyone who uses the word toxic masculinity is either a woman or gay who knows they can’t be me
"if you don't cry and you think crying is a bad thing, well WHAT EVER. does that mean you should drag other people down? NO. then does it mean you should shove it in to peoples faces? NO. tf are yall thinking.
oh and gay isn't a bad thing lmao"
 @liacooper7145  crying is a sign of weakness. It shows you lack self control and discipline so yes it’s a sure way to tell when one is gay because as african men we are built tough growing up I never saw men cry even when we lost loved ones  only women cry. Tears is a sign of weakness and only weak men are gay
 @user-er4st9ps5c  is that applieing to me?
 @KHEENGS  same here
 @hareetha1156  well said.
" @SriElMejor  
i only said about the ""men shouldn't cry"" part but its for everyone honestly.
but why does the other person that thinks men shouldn't cry keeps dragging down women and gay peoples? theres people that are gay men, women and even non-gay men that doesn't cry. and just because you cry doesn't mean your weak. idc if you think men shouldn't cry but saying that people who cry is weak and dragging them down just doesn't look right to me.
im saying this in one reply to you since you seem to be agreeing to it."
 @user-er4st9ps5c  tbh idk maybe he was brought up that way you see ive got a lot of gay friends and they would be appalled by what he's saying
" @KHEENGS  you’re the best troll I’ve seen on the internet so far, thanks for making my day 😂"
" @KHEENGS  aw that's sad, sorry for you. all genders should be able to express their feelings."
 @KHEENGS  You will live a shorter life because of repressed emotions.
" @KHEENGS  My friend I think you are using the term gay wrong. Crying will not make you attracted to other men. Also men who don't cry are weaker because they care about what other people think of them, they are scared that they will be looked at as weak by crying. Also, just because men don't let out literal tears does not mean they are not hurt. Lastly, that type of thinking only leads to more problems. You mention africa, there are lots of problems in society there."
 @jutszkie5603  troll? Where?
 @zolasaigal  men are not women. Letting your feelings control you is a sign of weakness
 @flowerfleur8105  I rather die a young strong man than die weak old male
" @flowerfleur8105  yes, men do get hurt we are humans. No it doesn’t lead to more problems. Yes, we here in Africa have lots of problems but lgbt, feminism and infanticide isn’t part of it."
" @KHEENGS  i didn't say let them control you, you need control over yourself, but let them show. don't hide them. do that while keeping them controlled, that's a sign of strength."
 @zolasaigal  the only sign of strength is not showing emotions
 @KHEENGS  well u keep thinking that then. i hope u grow up and realize you're wrong.
 @zolasaigal  I am grown up that’s why I know for a fact. No man should ever cry.
" @KHEENGS  you might be a grown up, but you for sure ain't a man."
"I know! Why did they include Derek? He’s the best example of the worst parts of men’s rights activists. Also, why did they get only male MRA’s and only female feminists?"
"TRUEEEEEEE, as someone who identifies with both sides seeing him represent a side I believe in makes me cringe and ashamed, but thankfully the toxic minority do not make up the entire group"
Me almost every time the feminists spoke. But agreed Derrick had some very deranged ideas. Probably from the lack of a father figure.
He is so cringe
Saaaame. I couldn’t finish watching.
"Interesting how you perceive this video as having ""sides"". All I see is people using rational arguments, and other people regurgitating ideological dogma."
derek is cool no cap
Exactly
Machai Arcanum 👏🏼Amin👏🏼shishter/brother👏🏼
I agree. Derek was thrown in there just to disrupt and its unfortunate.
"yeah, those two were the most understandable ones.
If they were the only people in this discussion, this wouldn't probably have even 1M views because most people want to see controversy between feminists and men.
But I agree that those two could definitely have a really healthy and interesting debate about feminism and men's rights."
I feel like everyone was trying to understand each other but Derrick and maybe Kursat
" @anunwantedsoul3672   Kursat destroyed Mimi.

Mimi was the most ridiculous one, along with Ayesha."
Except she was very hostile towards him when he was trying to understand
 @anunwantedsoul3672  kursat was just bringing facts
Ironically she wasn't at all.
"@Jagson Opinions aren't facts, that's why it's an opinion"
" cartohead  Oh nah, I meant that opinions fundamentally cannot be correct nor incorrect however facts can be used to support one's opinion"
"if he has a appearance of deriik, u wouldn't"
Jagson privileges? what are you even talking ab
"liyexiang66 if he talked like derick, then no, I wouldn’t. I don’t care about what he looks like"
 @justanotheridiot6188  Although there are certain sciences proving that the brain is appealed to certain people and a big reason to why Derik might come off more rude(Still I think most of what he said is wrong and clashes with my opinion). Just a tidbit on metal biases though :). But still glad you appreciate words over appearance.
"Jagson hey, can you please tell us at least one personal experience? Just tryna get an insight"
A LITTLE?! This mans deserves full credit! We was the best among the men and some of the women bruh
 @teetee8676  you are aware the feminists were also bringing up their opinions to right
"0:39-0:42
1:46-1:56
3:31-3:57
5:09-5:10
5:21-5:22
5:23-5:40

Might do the whole vid later lol"
leahOmia i freaking love u for that thank u i hate derrick
leahOmia you. Are. A. Legend.
"for real, i felt so uncomfortable each time he spoke lol"
 @leahomia2779 PLEASE do the whole video
 @leahomia2779  omg our saviour 😭🙏
 @leahomia2779  omg bless you my braincells will be officially save
leahOmia You are a holy person but i want to laugh about his ignorance
bruh there’s nothing wrong with him lmao
 @paetoncraig9374  he is insane. You do realize that incels are responsible for hate crimes like shootings and stuff. I'm not saying he does that but hes in a group that does that. Plus he calls women inferior
"“I would never have a woman as a best friend” Okay, but in that sense your not going to be married, or in a committed relationship, because if you don’t feel that your marrying or dating your best friend, then what are women to you? Just tools for sex and babies?? I don’t understand this logic."
I don’t know how to interpret that the girls at the end hugged each other but the guys awkwardly just shook hands like did anyone else notice that
My suppression if fellings was caused by my mother who got angry when I was not worshipping her.
his idea of traditional is def women staying home serving men 😐
This would’ve been more productive if it was just Bea and Zack
i cringed every time derrick opened his mouth
the moment derrick called himself an incel i had to scroll to the comment section lol
"“I am an incel”
“I am an incel supporter”

Okay"
"bea and zach definitely carried, listening to each other's points having the most valid points"
Who voluntarily calls themselves an incel…?
I feel like Derrick is a coach potato but has energy when it comes to this topic
"I really hope, from the bottom of my heart, that Derrick reads these comments and starts thinking about them seriously. Not because I want him to feel bad, but because those three girls he spoke to are not the only ones feeling this way."
Why should you need a men’s rights group…..omg girl we’re you oblivious to the whole conversation that kersat said. He’s giving you facts about real life discrimination and you still ask why men need a group to speak for their hardships…..geez
i just know these three women had the most heated lunch after this
"Derrick: Says he is a youtuber 


Also Derrick: Hasn't uploaded a video in 1 year"
I think it would have been good if there would also be a “men-feminist” talking
Derrick looks like his name is Gavin
If only Kursat had more screentime
I think this is the only episode where they didn’t hug each other in the end.
"Could we have the debates uncut? I’d like to hear the actual conversation and  it not cutting off all the sudden. I bet there would be a lot of people willing to watch the whole debate, regardless of it being 2 hours. You could post separate videos"
"He expects all women to love and worship him, without returning the care and respect in return. It’s a one sided relationship he craves, so it’s a one sided relationship he’ll get (but one that doesn’t benefit him)."
Well I partially agree with what he is saying here. I don't think I think the same way as a lot of women so my best friend would probably never be a girl. The girl I marry doesn't have to be my best friend that's why there is a best man position. I feel like your best friend would be someone you would talk to after you get in a fight with your girlfriend or to talk about stuff that you are to embarrass to talk about with your girlfriend.
" @lawrencenguyen7326  as someone who is in a loving, healthy relationship and has a fair amount of guy friends, I feel sorry for you. Without realising, you’re denying yourself a lot of untouched happiness in your life because of your self-imposed parameters."
His logic is misogyny.
 @hollygraham2890  Well said! Why wouldn’t you want to talk to your wife about everything? Isn’t that what being a partner/spouse is about? Sharing your life with someone?
Yes
Women would be all over him if he resembled a Greek god or something though haha
 @user-xm8lc1om6w  i dunno about that. Misogyny isn’t attractive to me whatsoever. Neither is abuse.
" @user-xm8lc1om6w  Arguably, men do the same thing. XD The term “Trophy Wife” comes to mind."
 @wolfstar5000  Yeah it’s one hell of a cruel world haha
 @lexileonard1212  Wow if my girlfriend had only male friends I would get rrly jealous. But that’s just me lol.
" @lawrencenguyen7326  nah it’s not just you bro/. That’s you being a man and and that’s you being realistic. Unless those dudes are gay, they prolly have fantasies about your girl and that’s just facts."
 @vee4490  yeah I don’t rrly trust girls with male friends. It’s like she’s leading them all on yk. Like you can have male friends if you’re a girl but if you only hang out with boys then there is going to be tension and the girl knows that.
 @lawrencenguyen7326  exactly
" @vee4490  well if you don’t trust a girlfriend to go out with straight male friends than that means your relationship isn’t too good, a good relationship should always be one where you can trust your partner and if thats not the case than I feel kinda bad."
 @lawrencenguyen7326  Even if they do have crushes on her you should trust her to be loyal trust is a vital part of relationships.
" @trtledude  if I had a luxurious car and I parked it in a known place for criminal activity, should I just trust the security system that nothing bad will happen?  Humans are weak when it comes to temptations and always come to breaking point. So no I don’t feel comfortable with that and I won’t allow it. Sounds like you haven’t a good dose of reality, go outside sometime 👍"
 @trtledude  no I didn’t mean in a relationship I meant in general. If a girl only has male friends and never hangs out with females she is literally going to make tension between boys. If a girl doesn’t know that hanging around with multiple boys all the time won’t create tension then idk what to say tbh.
 @trtledude  no he’s saying when your girlfriend only has male friends. If your boyfriend only hung out with girls that would make any girl feel uncomfortable. Why am I not allowed to feel uncomfortable if my girlfriend only hangs out with boys.
" @vee4490  Well, if your set in your values, (not cheating) it’s far easier to not do it. It’s actually more often that men cheat. If you trust your partner and his/her core values. Then you should be alright. It’s also far easier to say no to something if you already know your going to say no. XD Like someone trying to convince you to jump off a bridge, you know it’s a bad idea so you don’t do it."
 @lawrencenguyen7326  Look at previous comment. ^^^
" @wolfstar5000  the only time this “trust” works is if this person has proven it to you with something to back it up, like a 15-20 year marriage, but people aren’t built like that today. We live in a generation of thots and infidelity."
 @wolfstar5000  don’t say men cheat more. Studies show that women cheat just as much but they are more likely to get away with it.
 @lawrencenguyen7326  so using your logic if your girlfriend was say pansexual would she just not be able to have friends 😂
 @trtledude  I’ve never acc thought abt that. Well if anything I would be rrly happy that she chose me out of all the potential partners she could’ve had. I would probably make an exception for her.
 @wolfstar5000  there's just stuff you wanna talk with your bro and you leave the rest for your gf it ain't that hard to understand
" @trtledude  it's not that he doesn't trust his partner, he doesn't trust the guys out there because he himself is a man and knows what they can do"
" @MarL58  Well, then that would be rape. XD Its not cheating if a random guy starts hitting on you and you say no."
" @lawrencenguyen7326  bruh a girl can have male friends without being attracted to any of them and guys can have female friends without being attracted to them either. I have guy friends and none of them are attracted to me neither am I to them. But even if they would be, you can just reject them and make it ckear you have no interest. That's not stringing men along."
" @lawrencenguyen7326  also if you would trust a pan woman to be loyal to you, then you should trust a straight woman too. Jelousy is almost all about insecurity. Your girlfriend won't get with any guy just as you wouldn't get with any girl. She is with you for a reason. Ofc there are women and men who do cheat, but FUCK 'EM!"
 @kdodoqpqldbfjgklw  No I’m saying girls that only have guy friends. Like what that other girl was saying.
" @lawrencenguyen7326  yea but some girls just have better chemistry with guys, I once had only guy friends, and there can be no romantic nor sexual tension there"
"I agree with you on so many levels 👌
I heard this on line in a song ""dear future husband"" by Meghan and I fell I is totally  true ""you got that 9 to 5 but baby so do I so don't  expect me to be home and baking apple pies"" 
I don't  know  why women  are always entitled  to be doing  housework  and raising  children it should  be a shared responsibility  just because  you are born a women ?? 
Nobody  chose to be one"
" @lawrencenguyen7326  I see your point. And I agree that you are more comfortable to talk about certain things with your guy best friend. But I am part of the mindset, that you can have many best friends. Like of course my best friend is a girl BUT my boyfriend is my best guy friend with whom I also talk everything about. I can't find anything I wouldn't talk or do with my boyfriend that I don't already do with my best girlfriend. And when we fight, we talk with each other about it and not with another person. I think it leads to an unhappy relationship when you are not open with one another like in your example."
pure inhereted misogyny
 @MaryArts  Well sometimes when you get in an argument you need a third party to tell you if you are in the wrong or not. A good best friend will always tell you the truth with no bias. I wouldn’t talk about my relationship with another girl bc it’s a little weird for me.
" @lawrencenguyen7326  Of course. But after you got your guidance from the third party, you go to your girlfriend and work it out with the guidance in mind. So in the end you talk to your girlfriend about everything and not to the third party."
 @MaryArts  Ik but the only person that would be my third party would be my best friend. So that’s why I wouldn’t consider my girlfriend my best friend more like most important person.
" @MaryArts  You proved my point there friend, thank you"
" @lawrencenguyen7326  look, you might have an issue talking about sensetive stuff with a girl, but that doesn't have to mean that your girlfriend would have an issue talking about that with a dude. She can be comfortable around them, without being attracted to them and same goes the other way. Jelousy is a form of insecurity so if you get jelous, you shouldn't blame it on your partner (as long as they are still treating you right) and you should try to work on yourself. I also do get jelous if my boyfriend is around girls, but that's my issue, not his."
" @kdodoqpqldbfjgklw  Yeah that’s true but if she is telling another man abt our relationship idk it just rubs me off the wrong way. I want to be her number one man yk but if she feels more comfortable talking abt it with another guy than me, I feel like I failed somewhere along the relationship. If it’s another girl she is talking to I feel more at ease."
" @lawrencenguyen7326  bro you'll still be her number 1 man, she is in a relationship with you, so ofc you would matter the most to her. Obviously if she is only talking to her friends about relationship stuff and not with you then that's not good. But just as you would maybe first talk to your guy best friend about, say an argument, you'd talk go your girlfriend afterwards about it. Same goes for her."
 @kdodoqpqldbfjgklw  Idk if it is just me but if my girl goes to another man after we get into a fight it just makes me feel uneasy.
" @lawrencenguyen7326  so... you can go to another man after an argument... but your girl can't? Again, that's a you problem"
 @kdodoqpqldbfjgklw  I wouldn’t go to another girl after the argument. Yeah I just don’t like the thought of another man comforting my girlfriend.
" @lawrencenguyen7326  yea you might not go to another girl after and argument, cuz I'm asuming you don't have a girl bestfriend. But a woman can have a guy bestfriend without any sexual nor romantic tension there, she'll go there to vent and ask for advice after an argument but then come to you and talk to you because at the end of the day, she chose YOU, she's attracted to YOU, she wants to be with YOU, no one else."
 @kdodoqpqldbfjgklw  yeah your right.
 @lawrencenguyen7326  but yea you were really calm and respectful (unlike other people) so thank you for this conversation :)
 @kdodoqpqldbfjgklw  yea you too they were attacking me and accusing me of seeing my girlfriend as a baby making sex machine idk how they can say that when they don’t even know me.
 @oopsiedaisy6096  the uncomfortable nature of it tho 😂😂😂
Because if they started hugging each other they would have to hug Derrick...
They cant show their feelings cause theyd think its gay
 @wowzerbowser  😂 Ik Ik.  I was referring to a vine
I think the men didn’t all agree with each other
"Níamh Ní Tomhnair because they formed their own beliefs while the woman appear to have been influenced by other feminists,though they were a lot better than most feminists I’ve encountered(to which I openly call feminazis)"
Ramisa Tora two bros chillin in the hot tub five feet apart cause they’re not gay 💀
 @mobslayer211  I think only derrick had noticeably different view ponts. The other two guys had the same opinion on a lot of issues
Because toxic masculinity says “Real men don’t hug.”
 @jimmyyang4779  looooolllll
It’s not manly or “appropriate” to hug strangers unless you’re a woman lol
 @oopsiedaisy6096  i think that's another issue. The mentality of touching a man is gay. When in reality gay is the ATTRACTION to the same gender. Actions speak less as loud than words in this case.
 @alexesquivel8566  to me it is :)
They didn't say no homo
 @VisionVaultArchive  how's that toxic
 @kimjongunstan2912  no because they didn't feel the need too
 @VisionVaultArchive  are you serious the Bro hug is the manliest thing on earth and the idea that men dont cry due to society or hug is wrong they just don't want to
 @VisionVaultArchive  Because toxic feminity says just because women are hugging men need to too.
 @sleep_me_now  lmao
Internal emotional oppression
" @frakus3068  It's toxic because if you are a man that likes to hug (obviously with consent), you are deemed ""not a real man."""
Actually the guys were expecting the whole group to come together but the girls turned away and did a girl group hug
 @theonlyonewithgum1452  not really
"Dele Alli “Real mean don’t hug” 
Man who hugs enters chat*
Man who hugs is not a ‘real man’ based on said ideal. 
How do you not see how that can be toxic?"
 @theonlyonewithgum1452  no one says that ever heard of a bro hug? Most men just don't wanna hug. I have friends that like to hug all the time to each their own
" @frakus3068  ""No one says that."" There are literal people that support this black and white thinking. (There are people who say the earth is flat, so this isn't that far of a stretch.) The whole point is saying that this type of thinking is wrong/doesn't make sense."
 @theonlyonewithgum1452  yes its wrong but how is that toxic masculinity even some woman think like that
" @frakus3068  Toxic masculinity does not mean it is only enforced or espoused by men. It also doesn't mean it is inherent in all men. Toxic masculinity is just a collection of narrowminded (black or white), traditional views of how a man has to be in order to be a 'real man.' Men AND women can and do enforce these gender roles."
 @theonlyonewithgum1452  that's not really toxic masculinity that's just a person being toxic
" @frakus3068  ...No, it's a specific form of toxicity. Just like a cat is a specific type of animal and not 'just an animal.' 


Rigid, traditional views on what masculinity means=toxic masculinity. I really don't see how this is rocket science.


Maybe this will help: women and men have can have 'masculine' traits. 'Masculinity' is not solely inherent to men; therefore, toxic masculinity is not solely inherent to men."
They gotta just say no homo first
pshhhh.
LMAO YOU COULD JUST SAY “his” AND WE KNOW WHO IT IS😭
"Dude seriously....he was like, the older time we’re better, why bruh? So we could stay at home and make u dinner and never argue? His pudgy ass just hurt cause he could never get a girl"
"Yes on one hand. On the other hand, it means men protecting women, providing for women, and building society. I'm not really sure that's a bad arrangement."
victor odutokun i mean women can do that by themself? they don’t need a man to protect them or provide for them
"Karolina Dahl yeah, traditions are ok, and people can follow them as much as they want no matter how old. BUT, you should have freedom. So not every girl should be just housewife but if they want to, they can. Not Everyman has to work and do physical labor for money, but they can."
"✨ those ✨ Chicas absolutely, if a women WANT to be a housewife then go ahead. and if a man WANTS to be masculine then go ahead etc etc. but not every women want a man to protect them and men should not think that all women want protection"
I like how you say his and we all know who it be.
"that is traditional, not saying its right, but looking at ancient times, and even the 60s, women have stayed home while the men worked, again not saying it’s right."
@Jihyun Kim 🤦
"It's not his idea, it's the Bible's and not just serving Men. When you serve at Home it shows positively to everyone around you. Doesn't mean women can't work, but their priorities should be being a blessing in their immediate surroundings:)"
"Truth is women were much happier living like that than by being childless and chasing empty office careers like they do now.
It's not a coincidence that the higher becomes the rate of women working, the higher becomes the rate of female depression."
​@Jihyun Kim Wishful thinking cannot stop men who want to harm women (a.k.a. criminals). Only other men willing to use violence (a.k.a. the police/military) can.
That's called traditional gender roles. Women generally wanna stay at home and take care of the kids.
Pommy lol I do? Damn I didn’t realize that was what I wanted. Look at me over here having thoughts and dreams of being something more than a babysitter. Silly me
" @kealanis9531  You're most likely young and haven't realized it, yet. Most women generally wanna stay at home and be a mom. There's nothing wrong with being a stay at home mom. In fact, I have more respect for these types of moms more than any other."
 @kealanis9531  It's not called babysitting. It's called being a mom.
Pommy that’s great for those ladies but also please don’t generalize all women as wanting to be stay at home moms. Being a mom is also very very not on my mind and something I don’t ever want to do. Why don’t you respect working moms as much?
Landon Hawk AGREED
Landon Hawk yea
yes.
"100%. I really liked his questions. He tried to listen more than talk, but still give his opinion."
Agreed
Landon Hawk I don’t think so I think each person had their own unique insight that added to the conversation.
Zack was definitely an active listener and did ask questions to understand
Yup
he is correct sorry lil bro
"Cope, Mimi is far less intelligent than him"
starseekernate Did he not just contradict himself with that statement?
 @angelgjr1999  You can support your own group
Yeah.. That's some great typecasting right there.
Agreed. I wanted a longer discussion between just those two
"Yes, they were really understanding"
"No, the other guy(definetly not derrick) had the best points, unfortunately he was quiet"
" @sirmuys1774  I totally agree Kursat had straight facts and there was no counter for anything he said really, because it would mean you would have to have done your own research and been well read on issues. Not just opinions (right or wrong) and personal experience."
" @ygj4273  I agree, they even cut out most of his points and the evidence he presented. He explains some of it on his channel"
 @ygj4273  he was the best one there imo
A what
He's literally the walking definition of incel
Derrick was speaking facts though
Blez War virgin
He wont. he cant think. I really see people just like him here so that would make him feel like he is right
People like that think that they are always right and can never be wrong the only way for him to change is him actually wanting to change
I wish he had to pay my taxes. Lol
"I mean most of them are making fun of him, personally someone who is misogynist getting bullied doesn't make me want to change"
 @famine3141  he won’t because he’s an incel. He’s already part of a community that thinks exactly like him and do their best to keep him thinking low about himself until he doesn’t want to anymore.
"No, she kind of has a point. The MRAs, for example, said men are discriminated in custody cases but also said men are worse parents. Why is that needed?"
"​​ @regisglass5464  why are women the majority of those in care positions?

Take your anti-male points elsewhere."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  I am answering your question. Again, do you agree with the feminists that the sexes are equal or with the MRAs that men are inherently worse parents?"
"​​ @regisglass5464  No, I disagree that the sexes are equal. Men and women have completely different strengths.

Why are you so keen for people to agree with feminism? You're not going to convince me of it as feminism is fundamentally flawed."
lmao he has 2k subs he cant even monetize his vids
He deleted his vids from this year
Where is his channel?
 @Axolity_  Look under the description.
" @pelhamrechtsanwalt2416  Funny how you're using incel here as an insult when Derrick was recently on another of Jubilee's videos as a self-proclaimed incel himself. But if you followed him you would know that, right?"
He's covering up for the fact that he's unemployed
And female mens'-rights activists because they exist too.
We could start a Equlist rights activism
 @unluckybrov9440  feminism is about equality between genders
 @tom-pt2lt  men can absolutely be feminists! Feminism is about gender equality. Neither men or women should be superior according to feminism. That one argument about men being treated unfairly in family court is absolutely part of feminism. Feminism is supposed to defy gender norms and create an equal standing in society for everyone.
 @madeleinelou3820  its not. feminism aims for the liberation of women from the patrairchy society
" @madeleinelou3820  men can’t be feminist, sympathizing with a cause doesn’t make you a part of it, for example, you can support the lgbt+ community but that doesn’t make you gay by default lmao"
" @candepuntoexe  according to the Oxford dictionary the definition of feminism is “the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes. ” which means the fight is not directly against patriarchy, it’s against inequality."
" @lyingcat_  by definition feminism is “the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.” Which means you can be an advocate of women’s rights without necessarily being a woman. Feminism isn’t the same as being LGBTQ+, being an advocate for them is being an ally. Feminism is quite literally he act of advocating for equal rights. They can not be compared the same way."
 @tom-pt2lt  I'm a male feminist tho lol
"I was hoping there would be one and there are also women ""men's rights activists"" too"
 @tom-pt2lt  men can be feminists too
 @madeleinelou3820  its about women's liberation. men aren't a part of that. thatd be egalitarianism
 @elizabethong7567  they can be allies. how are men going to be a part of a movement thats for the liberation of women?
" @user-uz8ij5bp5m  you might wanna look up egalitarianism, which you're probably mistaking 'feminism' for, because feminism is for and by women only"
 @tom-pt2lt  wouldn't it be a good thing that a man can be a feminist tho? As a man I can use my privilege and educate other men. (Because most men don't listen to women)
"plss yt feminists are sooo focused on including men and another useless things when much worse things are happening in the rest of the world. feminism fights for the liberation of women from the patrairchy society and, as a consequence, there is equality. it does not include men because is not a movement that concerns them. me as a woman im not going to talk in the name of the trans movement and try to have a position in there because it does not concern me. we can always educate ourselves and speak about these things to other people in order to make them understand but trying to be part and call yourself a feminist as a man doesnt make any sense"
" @candepuntoexe   but men can support feminism. I'm a man and I support it. I understand that women are oppressed which is why I'm trying to use my privilege to make things right. Feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the genders"" this includes men as well as women as well as all the other genders. Men face a higher suicide rate than women due to society telling us to suppress our emotions and feelings because it will be viewed as weak. However I am also aware that women face more problems than men like the pay gap and being assaulted. I'm disgusted that 97-98% of women have been sexually assaulted or harassed due to men. And that's something I want to change. I am a feminist."
I'm a female men's rights activist but I do not support everything the men said in this video
Nahh too much cringe
" @user-uz8ij5bp5m  men can obviously support feminism but why do you want to have a name on it? and no, feminism fights for only women, not men too. there is a difference beetwen understanding that depending on your race, sexuality, nationality, etc everywoman struggles with different things but feminism does not include those fights in its movement. and yes, men are affected by the patriarchy society too, as every other person, but, as a woman, i cant talk about it on behalf of men, because it isnt something that Ive lived, but I can always understand it and support them but i never have to take their own spaces in the men's right movement because Im not a man"
" @tom-pt2lt  this is where society is going wrong. Feminism is not for women, it's for humans. Men can be feminists too"
" @tom-pt2lt  According to the Oxford dictionary, feminism is “the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.” So technically feminism is what you just called equalitarianism as it is based on equality of the sexes."
 @tom-pt2lt  ok incel
 @candepuntoexe  so that's a problem? In my country female foeticide exists and you're asking men not to be feminist?
 @deletedaccount6498  femcel* x
all activism needs those affected to be the ones advocating for the changes they need. no one argues this with any other cause so why with feminism must everyone be included??? its for women like trans right are for trans people and blm is for and by black people etc
"@xx_PlutoJJ_xx feminism is for women, inclusive of nb/trans afab as theyre affected by sex based opression (but not always gender based (they also have trans right activism)). Tran women, yes theyre naturally included in gender equality issues. They also have trans rights activism, which cis women arent a part of, which isnt a bad thing nor should i be fighting for them to include me because its simply not about me. Much like feminism simply isnt about or for men"
"I think a lot of men fail to realize that these patriarchal structures our society has built over centuries affect them negatively as well. This is what feminists are trying to overcome! We ALL would benefit from new and equal structures. Like they said in the video, family structures and crime bias are a direct result of patriarchy as well. Basically, we all want the same thing! Just some people are too egotistical to realize that."
capitu nossiter because the men would have probably been accused of sexual assault
Give Me Pizza get lost man
" @givemepizza4635  
Very original"
 @bobtheball5384  ok boomer
" @littlefinger4509  
o o F"
 @tsarivantheterrible1256  He isn't wrong though XD
Give Me Pizza  more like because the women were grossed out by them. “men’s rights” give me a break
"USMCplzzz are you freakin kidding me? “victim hood complexes” how about you turn into a girl for a day and see what happens? having to worry about what you’re going to wear cuz you don’t want to “provoke” a man and at what time you should or shouldn’t be walking in the streets alone worrying about getting rapped. it’s actually really fun, we get a good laugh out of it, life for women is easy breezy."
"capitu nossiter 
I’m a female, but I don’t understand. Idk if it’s because I live in the UK, but men are super respectful and most women are confident as hell. Like have you ever been to comic con?"
The females would’ve felt threatened🙄
"Spill The Tae • i rly don’t know about the UK (even though i love going there in vacation) but i live in Italy and here women are constantly assaulted not just physically but also verbally and i can promise you i’m scared every single time i get a bus by myself when it’s dark, i try to avoid it as much as possible. i’m obviously not saying all men are rapists, most of them aren’t (i hope lol), i’m just saying rape is a real thing. it happens. it can also happen with boys. let’s just not diminish this problem, cuz it’s a real one. 

hope that helped ☺️"
I wouldn't hug those men either.
"Ade People defend women because literal STATISTICS and FACTS show that 1 in five women have been sexually assaulted, and 91% of all sexual assaults are against women. It’s really not that difficult to understand that chances are, the woman has been assaulted."
 @capi9645  That's literally exactly what he means by victimhood complex. Like right on the nose
"A Erin A thank you, it’s good to know there are actually sane people in this comment section."
" @USMCplzzz  I'm sincerely confused whether this is a joke or not
I hope so"
"lelennyfox34 Rome, Italy. 
but it rly doesn’t matter, it could happen anywhere even in freaking Canada."
"lelennyfox34 dude you have no idea what you’re talking about. those statistics are probably wrong cuz there are even MORE women who get assaulted but don’t have the courage to report it. please inform yourself, for the worlds sake."
"LT Motions why? You hope so because your feelings can’t handle reality.

You seriously think nobody could possibly be a victim but you? Even when victims are properly acknowledged in society still you feel that demonizing people because it fits the cult like narrative is “woke”.

Then you need to really wake up, because that ego is just blinding you"
LT Motions unfortunately it’s not 🙄
" @capi9645  I've been a girl for 27 years and my brain went to the ""men would probably have a hug turned against them"" too. That isnt a victimhood complex that is a horrible reality in modern times."
"capitu nossiter that’s right 🙄 eye roll because you don’t want to see the plane and blatant sexism against men.

“Oh but men hold the power in society so it’s only right that we can be sexist to them it’s ok”

That’s all you think about, not about deeper thing like policies put in place by the very men you clearly are just jealous of."
 @USMCplzzz  Except the one in the middle was literally taking their sides when it came to less controversial things that we can all agree on like men's shelters.
"TempleAmarok hahaha i wouldn’t mind hugging a man, the gender is not the problem honey. i just said i wouldn’t hug that specific man. a sexist. as i wouldn’t hug a racist or a homophobe."
"T C and thank god! Because I think that would be something ANYONE could agree on. Man or woman. So the fact that only one in the three feminists shown resembles how little most feminists think of men is quite frightening.

The fact that feminism has over corrected society towards hating men for their very masculinity is alarming considering that Democrats PRIDE themselves on being “equal”"
lelennyfox34 tell me the name of this so called study and i’ll see for myself thank you very much.
"T C if we are going to take issue with societal issues, blaming one side for existing is the first way to fail entirely"
"T C it’s so easy for one side to say something is untrue when all it takes to find the truth is a little effort on humbling oneself.

Entertaining the thought that just MAYBE, I might’ve been wrong, and being strong enough to admit it"
"7hinkable i assure you feminists don’t hate men. we just want equality, it’s as simple as that."
" @capi9645  well you can make the same case for men. Statistically 3% of men have been assaulted or experienced an attempt to do so. 10% of all rape victims are male. The numbers could be higher given that men are supposed to be strong and not raped, leading to less numbers of reported incidents"
 @Wandervenn  Except most men don't have hugs turned against them so what do you mean?
"Ryan Guo you’re right about the statistics but i don’t see how that has anything to do with what i said. i wasn’t denying rape also happens to men, i actually said they do somewhere, just look through the replies."
"but please believe me when i tell you there are a lot of feminists like me that absolutely do not believe women are superior to men, and think that’s just as absurd as men saying they’re superior to women."
"Everyone has the same damn rights! Just because an entirely equal country hasn’t voted a woman to power doesn’t mean anything.

What are we just supposed to vote ANYONE into power regardless of politicy? What we want to be the most progressive generation without any clue as to how regressive an idea it is to vote for someone because of their skin color or genitalia.

THATis the racism and sexism overlooked by the left"
 @ItsLxyla-pewpew  yea that's my point it's looked down by both men and women. So I'm saying things are improving and u shouldn't be scared 24/7 🤷‍♂️
 lelennyfox34  exactly that woman saying she has had over 30 encounters with sexual assault if baffling not even my sister has had one encounter either she is always at the wrong place or she is not a very nice person as she would like to believe.
 @capi9645  he wasn't sexist man feminists just love throwing those words around like rape claims 😂( sorry). Anyways his view is more traditional and likes how things were mother father and man provides. I'm a guy and I would love to stay at home while my woman works. People are different 😂🤷‍♂️
"lelennyfox34 it’s not a question of dressing nice, it’s a question of not dressing provokingly."
lelennyfox34 what did i say to make u think that? can u guys read?
Ade saying women shouldn’t work and stay at home and fill their “women role” like they’re saying is SEXIST
Ryan Guo I Hope you realise that is significantly lower than womens sexual assault. Also it’s actually 9% of cases of sexual assault are against men.
"Ade There are different places where harassment is worse. And obviously if a woman fits a lot of beauty standards, she’s likely going to get harassed more. Just because your sister has never been harassed (which is great, I’m glad she’s never had to go through that) It doesn’t mean no woman has ever. It’s a bit weird to deny that she’s been harassed that many times."
"USMCplzzz Sure, same rights, but does this necessarily mean equality? Not in the slightest. I really don’t understand how you can continue to dismiss real facts. Men are almost always the perpetrator in sexual and domestic crimes. Yes it happens to men too, literally no one has ever denied that in any loose sense, but somehow it’s an argument to dismiss the very large problem of the rates that it happens to women in."
A Erin A 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
 @ItsLxyla-pewpew  lol where tf do u live I feel bad u had to go through that oh well. Hope things get better for both men and women.
"Ade Lol yeah, it’s sad that people have to debate safety, it should be safe for people anyway. I used to live in a town in north wales, which wasn’t full of the kindest people, now I live in a bigger town near Milton Keynes in england, and people here aren’t necessarily nicer but keep to themselves a bit more. Hopefully things get better for everyone in the end."
"lelennyfox34 I mean it’s a bit weird that boobs are sexualised in the first place. Not sure why you’ve compared being provocatively dressed to being naked because obviously a naked person is going to get arrested, but wearing a short dress is literally not a big deal. Women should be allowed to wear whatever they want (as long as they’re not naked obviously) and not be harassed, it’s pretty simple."
"A Erin A EXACTLY  “dressing provocatively” obviously doesn’t mean walking around naked 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️, it’s just ridiculous we can’t wear a skirt without being catcalled or harassed (and i’m not saying it always happens, but it does, so deal with it)"
"honestly this so much, a lot of the people in this video on their own channels said that a lot of important stuff was cut from the video; it just seems disingenuous on Jubilee's part in how people in the video are portrayed.  Like do the participants get to consent to being in the video after they see all the edits?  It's very easy to edit out certain segments to make a person look a lot worse than they are."
"The Apost4te i mean i never specified the men in this video but okay, also even if they still are as bad, im still curious to hear everyone’s full opinions on the different matters.  Also jubilee does this on ALL their middle ground videos where my argument still stands"
"All you’re going to see is 
MRA: Facts, Logic Reasoning
Feminists: MY FEELINGS, MY STORY IM HURT"
The Apost4te Funny that my sex life is the one thing you try to attack instead of giving me a proper debate. Shows the dismissal of valid points in you
" @jpgamer1000  I think you can reproduce, but your children should be raised by someone with an (unbiased) education."
 @thisisforvids  How very authoritarian of you.
" @Apost4te  I've been falling feminist vs Mra and debunking videos for a while now and Mra are more facts, stats, and science were feminists are quoting a ten year old meme facts that were debunked the day it took off and every woman has my experiences or worse at all times"
"The Apost4te No rage, no bubble, only tired of the Radical 3rd wave feminist having a Victim mentality."
" @thisisforvids   like giving kids to the government to raise and expose them only to the left and feminist views with little to no exposure to the concept of different opinions and ideas yeah that works really well
If someone or something says they're unbiased rest assured it's biased as biased can be"
 @Apost4te   is your goal to teach and be one of the people that make a difference to others who might have a bias? i think the way you talk is super intelligent. but come one be the peace keeper and teach your knowledge to those who need to hear it the most. Thats how we help people :)
" @jpgamer1000   Turn the other cheek my brother, losing your temper in a debate never allows you to learn slash change others opinions. Speak to to others as friends and try not use strong language ( Radical 3rd wave feminist having a Victim mentality.) When your tired of something that is bothering you, changing other people opinions is the most effective way to go. I think you can make a difference just try and be nice about it."
thisisforvids by unbiased do you actually mean biased against him?
The Apost4te typical leftist response. “I don’t listen to anyone who disagrees with me”
" @TheMadHatter626  From what i seen, MRA deals more with problems of the law while feminism deals more with society/tradition/gender problems, but that doesn't mean they both can't have points though"
Brandon Sandwick hope he’s speaking what’s on my mind. He’s just the voice of the voiceless and I respect him for that. Don’t assume. There are a lot of us who side with him. Facts vs feeings
"daniel albo yeah very true, I understand that media outlets have their own views and obviously Jubilee is quite liberal but I don’t think it makes sense to label these videos “middle ground” when the moderators clearly are biased to one side."
 @samuelkung7736  who are the voiceless? arnt you just voicing you feelings? It wouldn't be the first time humans have used facts that will change over time to compel them to do something.  Things change so arguing on a point of facts is like saying this is what i believe for now.  Whats the difference between facts that change and Feelings? Have you learned about the crusades? People think they are right and then say its a fact. Facts change for everyone. You might know today your going to eat some food which is a fact for you but is not a fact for someone else. Is it proven that feelings are less valuable then Facts? If so can you please shed some light on your research? Have you done any studies on your own? Do you get you knowledge from online? the reason i ask is because you complained about the Feminism Movement and didn't state any facts or references. Which in my opinion is the same thing you said they were doing.  Hope i get a response from you my brother as i love to genuinely talk to people about these things.
“I feel empathy for the other side” notice Kursat has to look over and see what the girls thought before taking a step forward.
I want to see another fem try another Norah Vincent type project
I think this is the first time there really wasn’t a middle ground.
"Derrick: ""society""

Me: Lmao he tryna be Joker haha"
"The thing these men need to understand, that which is oppressing them comes from patriarchy and its tropes. Guys are treated in the family courts unfairly because patriarchy sees them as lesser when it comes to the family raising portion. Guys get harsher punishments because women are seen as more delicate and soft, thus escaping a stronger sentence. Patriarchy affected and defines everything about masculinity, from how tall, how much hair, of what physique is considered the most masculine. It denies men their emotional intelligence, too, and instead channels it to rage and anger.  If guys felt less judged, could speak more about their emotions, could make genuine connections, how much healthier and content they would be.  But these three don't see that and they don't see the effect it has had on women either."
Can I just say that Zach was genuinely trying to understand but Derrick was just acting like a animated character who thinks that he is better than everyone else.
"As someone named Derek, I'm just glad this ""Derrick""'s spelling is different than mine. I'm still embarrassed though. He doesn't represent men, nor most Dereks properly. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."
"Derrick: I’m also an incel
Everyone’s faces: ohhh boyyyyy"
"Everyone here bitching about derrick, apparently a guy is no longer allowed to have an opinion anymore!"
This must be the most toxic conversation in Jubilee's history.
"Erin vs Derrick

When an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. Battle for the ages"
I bet not even uncles like Derrick
Let's just say I didn't have to see them introducing themselves before knowing which one Derrick is.
Was Derrick just trolling or is he legit just like that as a person...?
Derrick looks exactly like the type of person he is.
Ironically in Ohio on the same day this was posted they took away tax on menstrual products... Interesting
5:10 that's when logic flew away from her mind.
"Derrick speaks:  
Me: starts praying"
"""...us going back to the past wouldn't be so bad...""
zooms into the black person in the room
I busted my hip laughing, and now I am internally bleeding"
Derrick is one of the most ignorant people I've ever seen lol
Also in the Democrats vs Republicans
Moema Madarasz facts
"men and women will never agree on one topic, equality for all, no matter the age, race, or ideas (i dont mean in the united states, i mean the world)"
They’ve done this middle ground before and it went way smoother
Captainsunny id say there was middle ground when they talked about the death penalty
Scientists v Flat Earthers?!?!
I think it was because of the people chosen
 @Griffin-sr3ej  The ladies in this were all anti-mens rights. Both sides didn't listen like they should have and just argued.
 @bensmith5581  I agree. Nearly everytime a question was asked it felt like the men were defending their points and the women were interrogating them. It was a lot less like a conversation than most of the others are
 @Griffin-sr3ej  which is a shame because jubilee has been a great platform for opening up debate and showing different perspectives for all to see.
there could be if people would open their minds and respect other people
"That's because they have chosen 3 men who dismiss all aspects of what the feminist movement is trying to do and they say all of it is bad and they have chosen 3 women who dismiss any type of critique one can have of aspects in the feminist movement. It would be interesting to also have someone (perhaps male) who understands and agrees and appriciates what good things the feminist movement has done (voting rights etc.) but can be critical of other aspects (de-platforming, trying to stop people from making jokes etc.). I wish we could have a discussion on that level but we are stuck with incels and latte sipping west coast liberals."
" @bensmith5581  They were all pro equality, for example when it comes to child custody."
ThYou c n no n
 @shoulders-of-giants  Matching on one point does not make you pro-equality. I believe most of them do want equality. But their individual's ways of trying to get it are counterproductive. They are more bothered about being right than what is right.
Moema Madarasz I feel like even they had some points that they did agree upon. But in this “conversation” I feel like actual men’s rights were not talked about. It was just spent tearing down women’s rights. The brought up 1 or 2 talking points but never really talked about them.
Tal Dishno777 not trying to be joker.. The joker movie was shedding light on young men in our society that are similar or even worse as Derrick and how that same society treats them. I just wrote this on another comment but  its fitting here too “a child that is not comforted by its village will burn it to feel its warmth”
 @sagejr9295  Bruh it's a joke
 @Melkweg7  its wasn't funny
" @trevorlefiles8633  the mf punchline is "":"" 
Not original, not funny did not laugh"
DareDB KPop no it’s a derrick talk
Omg I watch your vids!! So glad to see you here!
"In my school the kindest and smartest person in our school was called dereck. He was the type of person who was good at everything, making people inclined to be jealous and so naturally dislike him. Yet his kindness and willingness to treat everyone equally and speak kindly and honestly made even the slightest amount of hatred impossible. I aspire to be like derek he was a great man. : )"
M Forrest I appreciate your wholesome comment :)
Does that mean he is gay?
"nah bro he was immature, the other two were great, the girls were overly aggresive but derrick wasnt really the best"
"Tau Noctua they created those things centuries ago because women weren’t allowed to attend college, own property, or vote. Let alone invent something to help themselves."
"Nah, check out Flat Earthers vs Scientists"
Olivera Mitevska yeah that’s the worst one
 @kwayvldn3682  Trust me! It ain't.
Erin: that’s not vegan
 @DanDAlittleMan  You think my section is for trolling? Delete your comment NOW!
Bruh have you seen the flat Earthers one XD
" @jayda4405  Okay...and? Does that take away the good that it does for women? Just because a woman didn't invent it doesn't make it bad. Who cares about the gender of who invents something? That's literally the least important thing about the person aside from their race, sexuality, or religion."
" @florzinnha  Men have done almost every significant thing throughout history, it's not exactly fair seeing as women were prevented from doing things for most of history, but I think all the accomplishments of men proves we aren't useless."
"Nah, its the Flat earthers vs Science"
Soz but erin would win at least she cares about living beings unlike Derrick :(((
He's in another of their videos. It seems legit.
Michael Ross tuff
Michael Ross what video?
" @brxwneyedwxman_9564  ""I'm A Incel As Me Anything"" is the title."
MZH Comedy ohhh okay thank you
Your profile pic is derrick
 @icedonut2171  Mine? My profile picture is me lol...
"He’s not. Just look at his youtube (BrendioEEE). He has a title called “how Incels are groomed by traps” (a derogatory way of saying trans women) and on a community post about this video he uses the word “looksmaxxing” (aka what incels call improving how you look). If he’s trolling, it’s unidentifiable to being serious to me."
 @NathanielBTM  but you kinda look like Derrick.
 @XavielYouTube   you haven't gotten a clear picture of me or seen my face from all angels. So that's probably why you think that
" @NathanielBTM  oh yeah, Derricks hairstyle is a bit similar. But other than that your face is a lot narrower than his, its mostly the brown hair"
᚛ᚐᚅᚐᚔᚏᚐ᚜  there it is
Umm hehe i understand he is a incel sorry for the question.
That's what happens when a man is raised in a single mother household just saying.
Requix What? How does that have anything to with that? 😭😭
 @ideknidcbro  alot actually
" @requix11  As someone who has brothers and was raised in a single mother household, my brothers are not incels. They're quite the opposite, it depends on parenting."
( Dislike )
"murozman I’m pretty sure that’s not how parenting works. If your father was dead then you’d only have a mother to raise you but that doesn’t mean you turn out weak. And that doesn’t really excuse someone’s actions, as you get older you can tell right from wrong by yourself. I’m pretty sure we don’t all do what our parents tell us till  the day we die."
Oh be quiet! Derrick is just saying the truth.
" @ideknidcbro  I didn't say he doesn't have a chance to change and grow. He's a young man. Yes that is actually how parenting works by the way.  Children learn by example. 

I have personal experience in this myself actually. My mother was amazing and continued to instill good values in me after my father died at 11. I was however weak as a young man and I had to struggle to find my way in embracing my masculinity. I grew up surrounded by women."
ammarko1000 we got another one fellas
murozman no human being is ALWAYS surrounded by women. We go to school there are guys. We walk outside there’s are guys. We got to the store there are guys. Uncles? Grandfathers?
" @ideknidcbro  Those male figures exist yes but you need to have a more active male role model for it to count. I don't know why you dispute this,  the studies on the negative impact of fatherlessness are quite clear."
joey manionese riiii👏🏼
Bro...me too.
How is that funny?
he's a white man of course the old times were better for HIM
" @onlinedatingpolice7880  um. the history of the u.s.a. 
slavery, sharecropping, jim crow, segregation, and a number of other horrible things that have happened to black people. That is our past. Why in the world would any black person who would be specifically targeted by these time periods in the past think going back to the old days ""wouldn't be so bad"""
karma was fast
@humankinda so something being bad is funny?
"I doubt he's talking about going back over 150 years ago.. It's a fact that in the past blacks also had stronger and happier family units. Since the 60's to now, black children born to single parents has increased from roughly 20% to 70%."
I busted my hip laughing when i read this comment
 @Cybeldina I still wouldn't want  to live in the 60s
 @sofiavang5761  how is that funny?
@humankinda thank you for the elaboration
" @unknownmuslimah5085  its not actually funny its the irony that this guy actually had the audacity to say something like that with a black person sitting right there, thats whats funny."
online dating police ok boomer
 @onlinedatingpolice7880  someone didn't pay attention in history class
online dating police you’ve taken it too literally. Lol. Relax.
 @onlinedatingpolice7880  lighten up dawg
Sorry that I find this unfunny
i leave for 1 goddamned day and this is what happens.
These women are sooooo entitled.
"Derrick: I’m an incel.
Me: oh my it’s gonna be one of those debates."
I think everyone found the middle ground when it came to Derrick
"Toxic masculinity is real
BUT SO IS TOXIC FEMINISM"
Listening to this was difficult. 😂
I don’t think this conversation represented the best of either side. I’d take another shot at this conversation.
"Derrick has a Nintendo DS in his right pocket with Pokémon in the slot, don’t mess with him. He’s gonna throw out his trap card."
You can clearly see when the Fppl have no point they get mad and start telling stories about their life.. with that said my life doesn’t always resemble reality…just because no1 I know is starving does that mean world hunger doesn’t exist
"I feel like everyone there were educated on their subject, and wanted to learn a bit from the other side, and understand where they come from. And then there’s Derrick."
"Jubilee: Presents a good topic
Comments: DeRrIcK"
Bruh those dudes were insufferable especially Derrick and that PhD dude
Derrick looking like he living in his moms basement
Smash like
"I think Derrick has way too much anger built up for him to have a productive conversation.
Just looking at him, I already guessed he was an ""Incel"".
He seems very upset about it and I have a feeling that his anger towards women and general demeaner strongly contributes to why women reject him."
Derrick is just weird i am curious about how he treats his mom
I feel like Derrick was cursed to be this way the moment he was named Derrick
Men can’t be men. Ok. We got it ladies. 😂😂
"So I am reading all the comments about how Derrick sucks, and I'm like 'He can't be that bad, right?' And then I heard him call himself an Incel."
I wish they would’ve had some male feminists and some women are for men’s rights
Love you MiMi!!!!!
Polly ThePengiun haha that’s exactly what I said out loud
 @rickastley4993  I'm never gonna give you up.
"Not suprised really. I mean even as a virgin i just had to pause and say ""really?"". I think the ones that consider themselves incels should be in another group. The guy just make the arguments worse every time he speaks on mens rights side. Not by his presence but by his arguments too like during the child-woman comparison which was an absolute speech mine. The others were in silence as a negative answer but he just had to go ""i mean..."" the guy was on another frequence from others really."
" Truthful Chap  Draft has no connection to this. Women and men ARE adults. My point was the yellow jacket guy was starting ""i mean..."" while the guys were silent as a no. His ramblings about returning to 70's also annoyed me. I also wish there was a egalitarian or mans right woman and a male feminist too. Want see where the conversation would go really"
" Truthful Chap  My belief is if they want equal stuff they should pay equal cost too or give equal worth of work. Divorce rules, affirmative action, goverment aids, positive prejudice in court and law are not equal. They have to change. I just would rather choose men for draft in times of war and women as the house keeper cause you know biology and efficency. 

BTW i thought YOU were the white knight LOL:)"
" Truthful Chap  As a guy i wouldn't of course! But my own logic and statistics are against me in this. Man, i hope no war would break out in my life. I can see your point though."
Exactly!
In favour of?
We need more of Zach and Bea.
"I didnt think this was an accurate representation of either side. Should have picked a more polar feminist (one....please only one) to balance out Derrick. Unless you just get rid of Derrick bc he has no idea what hes talking about. 😂 also, next time get some men who actually are MRAs...like fighting for equality in parenting, breaking stigmas, etc. Because those are the men that could actually contribute to the conversation. And I felt like the women (mostly) were very anecdotal...can we get some actually educated people on both sides that dont necesarily identify as the extremes, but as advocates. I am DEFINITELY not a feminist, but I am an advocate for women. I want to see women elevate themselves without ""help"" and despite adversity. 
For example, i support the choice of women to be stay at home mothers, but I prefer to NOT do that and I am grateful that I have the ability to make that choice. 
Another example, white women have (statistically) the worst odds at getting into medical school even with the same curriculum vitae. 
Anyway...point is that the only arguments brought up are not indicative of the looming issues we all face - on either side."
" @keeganzavits3450  I definitely see where you're coming from. He did a good job of bringing up a lot of issues that men face, but I felt that he could have done it without emotion. He used objective facts/data, but was very condescending the way how he handled it. Let me know what you think."
yes and bring me in pls. Live in Canada but id fly over.
i volunteer
"I fully agree. need better representation for both sides. Add Paul Elam on the mens side and a woman like Karen Straughn or Janice Fiamingo and a man on the womans side like Steve Shives. the incel didnt help anyone learn anything at all, what so ever."
@Veit Zeret  I thought Bea was quite reasonable and was trying to have an actual discussion with the guys in the group. Mimi was pretty condescending and the other lady was just... overly emotional.
I dead thought he was a feminist lesbian at first
SkYinZo Collazo 😂😂😂
Isn't that yu-gi-oh? (I'm sorry i didn't understand the joke u.u)
Yes Pokémon in DS and trap cards in his pocket as well. Yugioh has Trap and Spell cards.
Kursadt was the only one that brought facts and actual arguments for his position.
No.
"None of them are actually working with the other side tho, they’re all so defensive."
"Marcianus Valerius they listened, just because they didn’t change their opinions and defended them instead doesn’t mean their arrogant simpletons"
Ray Man amen
" @rayman594  You won't be able to gaslight me with your silly rebuttal. I could say the same thing about you. You don't recognize by writing your comment that you are being arrogant, condescending and dismissive. Even if we assume what you said about me is true. Your circular logic fails and the fact that your comment got a dozen upvotes proves that this comment section is full of ideologues who will approve of any silly thing if it fits their narrative."
" @alyssuhm  They didn't listen. They just wanted to further their own narrative while completely dismissing the opposition. The girl who made that smug ""your little research remark"" is a prime example of that. But hey, that's how the average feminist operates. Arrogant and narcissistic with a complete lack of humility and self awareness."
"I completely disagree. All three of the women were calm the entire time, despite their words being shot down by invalid arguments."
 @girico121  women act like children so what's the difference?
 @misfitsBP18  act? How they act?
" @girico121  money hungry, greed and how they never take responsibility for their own actions, I say that's similar to children. Am i wrong?"
 @misfitsBP18  I don't what woman's do you know but the woman's that I know are nothing like this.
Marcianus Valerius small brain moment
" Shary Ce  
I'm telling you as a man, that it might as well be, at least to the extent and ways that feminist has pushed it. It has nothing to with sexism and all about peoples choices. Matter of fact, In the U.S. it has been  illegal to pay women less since 1963."
" @marcianusvalerius1992  
I wouldn't say they were low IQ, but some were condescending and didn't seem to have any empathy for what the other side was explaining. One was continually cutting off the other when speaking his side."
 @marcianusvalerius1992   eh. kindof.
exactly. I came here for the comments
Thats usually Jubilees videos in a nutshell. The comments are always about one thing usually
 @elizerclairisier6625  I can see that. I think this is the third time they have had feminists here on the panel. But at least we technically got feminists vs an incel
He probably is
He is.
Bro it’s not like every man would beat women it’s like just the crazy’s who did it and still do it. I honestly want to be a 50s house wife and just clean and cook and take care of my kids. Like that’s my dream
"So your gonna totally forget about ww1 and we2 which were major causes for these things. Not all men are gonna beat there wives. Also for feminists you want male and female equality, when men are usually protecting women and putting in all of the stress they significantly die younger then women their age. Also men have higher crime rates and you want equality. When men have all of these problems. Also when they say they can protect themselves they totally ignore the fact that men are protecting them. They are treating them like kings, while they are the soldiers fighting for them and the women don’t need to worry. Also they talking about upbringing when men are told to suppress their feelings and that is the cause for their problems. Is that equal?"
 @EnlargedBrain  I understand and agree with a lot of what you say. I’m saying this about Derrick because I believe if he was in the 50s he would definitely want it live in the standards that society had then and now for both men and women. It was a time where women were extremely oppressed and I think Derrick would beat his wife.
 @CreammMilk  I agree
 @rebekahshumway5083  what😀 you wont help her with chores? you wouldnt let her have a job? you wouldnt raise the kids?
 @aidenc4299  bro what
 @aidenc4299  read you can
" @rebekahshumway5083  Housewife’s still exist - with more rights and equality under the law. It means that woman has more choices available to her, should that situation be violent or she want to leave. The 1950’s was shitty, full of discrimination and white men’s entitlement and fear of change..that decade and centuries preceding it are what led to the 1960’s. And now. Change is inevitable, personal choice doesn’t matter in a societal scale."
" @EnlargedBrain  equality under the law and society is a unilateral understanding that everyone has individual choices they can make, and the law will view it as the same regardless of gender. It means we are all treated equally and given consideration for health issues. That’s what true feminism and men’s rights activists want. Freedom of communities and individuals from pre-taught gender roles - because gender roles which are at heart  just ugly gendered stereotypes from a bygone era."
" @katelyndodge2762  bro I know, I’m just saying that all husbands in the 1950s weren’t monsters, and i was supporting my statement saying that I would be one  of those wives"
I’m saying that both groups are useless. Neither need anymore rights and also I can’t respect any of them until they actually do something. Standing around and saying we need more rights for so and so doesn’t do anything. They should actually do something.
"When he said ""50s"" I'm sure he didn't mean he wanted to beat his wife. Actually,  you're kinda generalising any man in the 50s. I think he meant it as in ""traditionalism"". The man works 8 hours a day , 24/7 and pays all the bills , Taxes , child support , food , clothes , and for his wife and himself. The woman stays at home  and takes care of the kids , cleans the house , and cooks the food. This is what most of us want tbh. But now bcs of generalisation and being too scared to take the risk , some ppl won't do it. Women are afraid of being abused and men are afraid of being falsely accused. When those are rare occasions. These things should be taken into consideration before marriage and you should be able to 100% trust your partner."
" @katelyndodge2762  I think you know exactly what she meant so stop rambling about ""white men"" and ""discrimination"" that happened nearly a century ago."
 @rebekahshumway5083  that's what almost all of us wish for. Not all men are abusive and not all women will falsely accuse you. So go for it without worrying.
" @starbluelight12yearsago39  dude that I completely agree that would be nice and peaceful except I don’t wanna work at a dock, but what I’m saying was is that Derrick would want to be on the wrong side in a time like that."
 @CreammMilk  exactly
"exactly derrick is the only one ""lost"""
 Tre Shoni  das right imma get married and quit my job when I have kids and stay home and clean😗✌️
 @rebekahshumway5083  you can still wear dresses and cook and be racist calm down
 @ryland4198  calm down about what?
Dude not cool darik does not condone physical abuse stop spreading lies did you even listen to what he said
 @joshsmith3062  yes I listen what to said he
 @rebekahshumway5083  you can't read can you
 @ryland4198  nope I’m illiterate
" @jadedaniels4535  when did I say a women needs a man to protect them. That’s what guns are for. It’s just that as men we are perceived and are brought up as protectors and instructors and that is not a particularly bad thing. It’s just that women are  able to protect themselves, but they already can do that. Also women fail to acknowledge the role men have played in in their lives and ignore the good things. They tend to focus on bad things and don’t notice the good ones. Get a gun then and don’t have any men to protect you if that’s what youwant"
 @jadedaniels4535  only less than 0.000001 men are like Derrick no normal man thinks women are defenseless
"""uh D-Derrick. I think I might have... uh... burnt- i mean put a b-bit of ch-char on the meatloaf""
""TIME TO DIE!"""
 @rebekahshumway5083  child- yea ok u can do that
It was mostly woman not having rights though I hate Derrick there wasn’t that much beating.
 @rebekahshumway5083  Crazy women sometimes seek out abusive men and still do.
" @rebekahshumway5083  I think house spouse's are a bad idea, it puts more pressure on their partner while trying to provide for a family, our economy is garbage, and it's manipulative to have a man/woman to have to do all of the shitty work. It leads to divorce, manipulation, And Sexism. If men and women should be equal, men and women need to stop manipulating eachother. Men need to stop looking at women like they are gods, and women need to learn to get rejected by a potential partner. If we as a society can function as equals, we need to focus on everyone's rights."
 @EnlargedBrain  well that's exactly why feminism was created so that men won't have to protect women and have all of these problems
 @hedgefundphil  that’s weird
" @mrppman6188  ik but when I have kids someone is gonna have to stay home, and it only makes sense for the person with the milk to do it. Once my kids are in middle school I’m going back to work"
" @hshaizkcgahaj1916  and they don’t have too. But no feminism is crazy people advocate for rights and privileges they either already have, want more, and or have no backing that it is true."
 @rebekahshumway5083  once they are in Elementary school* That's just manipulation at it's finest.
 @rebekahshumway5083  would your children breastfeed at 7 years old?
 @mrppman6188  what do you mean manipulation? And no! My kids are gonna stop breastfeeding once they are ready to eat solid food! Wth dude why do you have to be so judgmental??
" @rebekahshumway5083  hear me out, when your child is old enough to go to school, you should be working and help to provide for the family."
 @mrppman6188  I wanna do PTO though
 @rebekahshumway5083  pto?
 @mrppman6188  parent teacher organization duh! I want to be the president at my kids school
" @rebekahshumway5083  uh, okay? How do you know if you will even be financially stable enough to have a child? Children cost a lot of money."
 @EnlargedBrain  since when is that what feminism is? U need to know about a topic before speaking on it
 @hshaizkcgahaj1916  I would like a history lesson
Um I don't think he may have one
He better treat her good he lives in her basement
he looks like a couch potato playing games all day and asking his mom for food
 @klairecaldwell7143   I don't know what to do with your comment
Joe mama
😏
He was on another jubilee
William Wykoff that’s exactly what he looks like Fr fr
He's different because women reject him en masse and he's however old he is and probably still a virgin and probably never had even one girlfriend. He was denied the opportunity to develop certain social and romantic skills due to said rejection from girls and later women.
Just because he looks weird doesn't he cant treat his mom right. Your just judging on appearences*
Zomgossom it’s not just that his personality for me just comes off really cocky and arrogant and just not flattering at all especially if you want someone to try and understand your viewpoint
 @izzy350  someone that cocky and arrogant is trying to cover up extreme insecurity
I mean he probably just talks to her normal and you know is normal after all he did say he loved her very much and she is a single mom so I think that he doesn’t really do anything that is bad he most likely is just a normal guy to her
 @izzy350  yea for sure I understand
Watch the incel one
his mom is probably a bad parent
nimbu 👏👏
I wonder how his mother has treated him
"morgan destiny that’s not typical, that’s stereotypical if anything"
Ronya Topal and his sister (if he has one)
" @zomgossom5789  But in all seriousness, yours is one of the few helpful and reasonable comments in this horrible section, congratulations."
"Pretty sure she’s abusive. Most guys with this mentality develop it by seeing a female cause significant harm in the absence of a male role model. Society doesn’t know how to handle an abusive women as efficiently as it does abusive men, so the kid comes away with two conclusions: 1) women will cause harm in the absence of a guy. 2) traditional patriarchal family structure is required to stop women from harming because society will not step in. I’ve dealt with alot of young men like Derrick. Give me 3 months and I’ll have him dressing right and walking tall."
"Protecting and over bearing, listing to video again, he's not traditionally sexist, he's just a narcissist."
 @FungusMossGnosis  thanks you too
@William Wykoff yes
" @MrCurbinator  You had me until "" 2) traditional patriarchal family structure is required to stop women from harming"". This sounds, honestly, retarded. 
People do become abusive in chaotic situations. The solution is a structure that fits the individuals and gives everyone a sense of freedom and proper communication. A trad Father Knows Best familial situation is not required for strong, upstanding men to be formed. Definitely not in every case."
"J. Patrick yeah i could have phrased that better. Basically what I’m trying to say is that he’ll argue for control measures on women because A) he saw none when he asked for outside help in his younger age. Once he passes that he’ll just revert to “a family without a patriarch is a ruin.” Theres also the fact that he wants to put men at a superior level because then he rises with the group, rather than coming out of his mental bunker to achieve something himself"
" @MrCurbinator  This makes much better sense. Thank you for clarifying. 
I used to be a libtard who bought into most of the stuff about the Sins of Patriarchy, and parts of the agitprop I still agree with. And think it's possible to be a sane, equality-feminist to this day in parts of the world (the Anglo West not so much!). I won't be red-pilled yet I disagree with liberals on almost everything now."
"MrCurbinator Exactly. Unfortunately few people who haven’t been abused themselves have trouble spotting the signs of abuse in others. I wholeheartedly believe his current demeanor, beliefs and behavior most likely stem from his childhood mistreatment. Just knowing his mother was a single parent should throw up some red flags. He probably lacked a good male role model/father figure and probably blames his mom for chasing away his father, leaving him fatherless, than actually blaming his father for not being a responsible father in the first place. That’s probably why he believes in traditional family values, though I think he had trouble articulating his views so I think most people misunderstood him. I was also raised by a single parent mother so in that way I can sympathize. I hope he can get the help he needs to become a better, more well rounded person who can see women aren’t the enemy he makes them out to be."
"loverrlee your right about the identification thing. I was saved by a man who took it upon himself to jump into my life. What I dodn’t know at the time was that he jumped in because he knew the signs. This requires direct intervention from a guy thats been there and was saved themselves. First stop: hair cut, then suit shop, then boxing gym. Everything after that is classified."
"I know two Derricks IRL.  They are both loving, supportive husbands & fathers and both of their families absolutely adore them.  The sentient bag of Cheetos in this clip is a false Derrick.  Maybe I can ask my Derricks to sponsor this kid in some kind of mentorship program.  I will email Jubilee about this..."
I have a cousin named Derrick who’s the same way.
what is an incel? sorry my first language isn’t english haha
" @nuri8351  Basically, someone who believes men are far greater than women, its short 'Voluntarily Celibate', and it's a group of men typically seen on sites like Reddit and 4Chan, though they don't represent everyone on those sites. Derrick, the guy in the yellow hoodie is one, and he compares the intelligence of a adult women to children, which is really not okay."
" @nuri8351  to correct stickursor (no disrespect stickursor) it's actually ""INvoluntarily celibate"". Look up Elliot rogers."
Honestly same because I watched the incle video and then I watched this and my entire opinion on him changed and I got to know his thinking a little bit better I suddenly grew to hate him.
" @stickursor8657  its actually short for involuntary celibate. Young men will sometimes get bitter over rejection or heartache and, if they let it fester, become sexist towards women in general."
"Still some things he believes in are questionable, especially frienships"
shirley lawrence exactly
"i cannot picture a ""woman who is for men's rights"".... what does that look like....how?"
" bla blahblah  you need to get a hobby, you've asked something 41 times and no one answering isn't a clue??"
Nah we got our lord and savior  DeRIcK
" @truongthuylan1990  most child abusers are women so.. that does not mean women don't get the custody rather its the opposite...
What point are you trying to make

Feminists always argue that men generalise women but now here we are.."
Yes!
Yeah I would love to hear what a women for male rights activist has to say
"no,"
"anyways Im all for men’s rights I feel they should be treated more equal and people shouldn’t force young boys to live a certain way and shame them if they wanna wear makeup or dress up, I mean you could be straight and do it for fun."
 @anyways111  hi ima girl
damn not everyone is a feminist don't you get that. just because you have the belief of a feminist doesn't make you one. its takes action to be a feminist.
the term feminist is popularised by way too many people.
shirley lawrence right? I would’ve been a good woman for men’s rights😳😳
I think it’s also very interesting that I know MANY male feminists but I know 0 female male rights activists. Maybe somebody does but I think that this shows some differences between feminism and male rights activists.
" @jagerbaby8628  human rights ofc, the point is that everyone should be treated/paid/etc equally... and they're not. i just couldn't imagine that any woman in this day and age would actually find a reason/come up w an idea/go out of her way to fight for the endangered male species lmao"
" bla blahblah  and sorry but i'm still hung up on you bringing up ""lifeboats"""
Me too
Men alwats hat rights tho so whats the point of menrights💀💀
shirley lawrence I don’t think there are any male feminists
 @samsnowden5403  there are
shirley lawrence I don’t think they have women for men’s rights
Well that “conversation” got us absolutely nowhere lol
"Me at the beginning if the video: derrick sounds like an incel...
Derrick: im an incel
Me: 0_____0"
Why does Derrick sit like that LMAO
"6:17 
1.) A lot of people do not realize that mothers play a role in this to, moreso than fathers some studies claim (& by a wide margin).
2.) if he said that, that means you treated him like a sub8 subhuman. JFL these women would rope in our shoes"
"""i'm an incel"" is the new ""that's not vegan"""
Should've got one woman men's rights activist and one man feminists
Damn you guys talk about Derrick but is but like Kursat was that different from him and i'm also feel sorry about Alyesha and you can see she has gone trough a lot of trauma
Literally everyone is looking at Derrick like “man what in the f-“
The other two sensible men trying to make good points and then Derrick “I am a...uh... incel”
"One of the feminists (not sure if she meant this) excepted all tampon products to be paid for. But who’s gonna pay for that?
Let’s say there’s 100,000,000 million women in U.S that have monthly periodis, times 10 dollars that’s 1 billion dollars a year, but it’s also 12 times a year so that’s 12 billion. Who’s gonna pay for that."
Anybody know what Derrick got into after this?  I feel like this is the origin story of a villain lol
"No one:

Derrick: so i'm an incel"
"i was trying to not hate on derrick but then he said “yeah, ok” to mimi after she told him to mind his business and we’ll .... here we are. THE NERVE"
Derrick is straight up high on all types of drugs
Oof I had a hard time watching this whole thing
Why don't we talk about toxic femininity that much then.
What do you think when you hear men’s rights? And she said she starts laughing 🤦‍♂️ that’s what’s wrong in the world people not taking stuff seriously for other groups not just gender stuff
I skipped every time derreck spoke
They should redo this without Derrick. Let the adults talk.
"I want to speak to the woman that hurt the swedish dude.
She's really affected him a lot."
"Well that depends. A dialogue isn’t really meant to have a solution, it’s to talk in an open and (hopefully) nonjudgmental space and use active listening skills to contribute meaningfully to a discussion that is relevant to the context, and not blabbing anything you wanna say because that doesn’t actually help anything. Another factor is how open people are to hearing the other side. You don’t have to completely accept the other side’s views, but the hope is that you’ll have a broader perspective and better understanding of perspectives that are different from yours."
"Salome Lau do you think any of these people in this video were truly open to hearing the other side though? 
Doesn’t seem like it to me."
" yada yada  in my opinion.. 
remember that.
I think a group of guys is more likely to have a tolerant one in the bunch, to speak against the others if they're not small minded.
Id assume some women agree with each other in a group because they fear the social conflict in front of others. Lets face it. Women care about image. They dont wanna be a nail sticking out."
 yada yada  men don't hive mind the women even commented each guy had varying viewpoints
"outsideworld76 People like you ruin these types of debates. While the real men are trying to have an honest discussion, you go for the low hanging fruit."
Feminism is doomed and this just proved it
"Daniel Prieto Hmmm men don’t care about image? Guys laugh when the other is rejected, not banging enough girls, they suck at a sport or a video game etc...
I do agree that in some female groups it might be less likely for them to agree with a male opposing side. Most girls hate fakes who are like omg I get along with guys soooo much better types. But this debate they all had the same values so ofc they’d agree. Not because they are women but they have the same beliefs. Men’s rights is important but not as vast as women’s rights. This the idea of men’s rights isn’t as fleshed out so yea it’s gonna vary more"
Why do you find pleasure in picking on people who can’t defend themselves from your hatred?
"Sir Uppercrust III The feminist side has no hatred, every bit of hatred I’ve witnessed in the video was from Derrick. He compared women to children, he said he would never be friends with a woman, he said he “has empathy for women being lost,” and he said going back to how things used to be during the patriarchy wouldn’t “be so bad” and would be a good idea. Now tell me, picking on him for his logic is not right? He deserves every single hate comment he is receiving on this comment section with no doubt."
"Lmfao ""CALLED IT!!"""
"Sir Uppercrust III I don’t support traditionalists when the tradition is to be overly sexist towards women. I am being defensive because if you read my first comment I point out the exact things that make me want to defend women from such a terrible human being. And I’m actually not being aggressive, if you can’t tell. I’m not yelling, I’m just trying to explain how terrible Derricks morals are."
I knew he was loco after the Marxist comment
Same
" @madelinesorensen6136  He doesn't deserve hatred. Hatred is not what being a goodhuman is about. These videos are made to diminish that exact attitude. People with differing opinions exist. True, Derrick is pretty extreme. Nonetheless, I believe we are not here to judge, we are here to learn and to communicate; to find middle ground. My guess is that it is due to his own personal history that he adopted and found refuge in this ideology - everybody has a story.


Stop the hate, it makes you no better than those you resent."
Hahaha IKR!!
First thought as well
Yeah that wouldve been interesting to see how one gender with a different view responds to the other gender with another
Pinecone Pressure good thing the women didn’t stumble because they sounded sexist as hell
Pinecone Pressure rewatch it and try not to be too narrow sighted then come back and tell me when they didn’t :)
^^^^^
"Pinecone Pressure you sure watched that 24 min video fast you sure your didn’t miss anything 

You may be too blind sighted to see but    Darrick didn’t mean to compare women to children and he may have sounded very condescending but he just isn’t as educated on the matter as the others 

All of them agreed men and women were better at different things but not superior 

Both groups had their fair share of hatred towards the way they felt the other sex had saw their point of view

Legitimately rewatch and try not to be biased and see what the women say about the men 
our different opinions further segregates us but provides more insight to the topic although you seem less educated on the matter

Bye (this will be my last comment here Im not much into drama, but fight your point like I know you will)"
"Nah, I get Derrick, man."
 @ethanadams8109  he definitely could have said his more alot better bc he came off as a guy who didn't really know alot of this topic i mean beyond have a good relationship with his mom
" @emmanuelwil-jeff  Honestly, I vibed off his lonliness. I have am honestly crippling fear of being alone. I guess you could call me an incel in that regard? Because of that I saw a connecting point and I could understand him better."
Ethan Hendrickson get some help fam
 @ethanadams8109  that's perfectly fine it was just obvious he shouldn't have been on if nothing else he rustled some jimmies
" @ethanadams8109  Yup, it's easy to just blame women for your loneliness I suppose instead of working on yourself. Don't take the easy way out."
 @Ray03595  I never said I blame women. I almost blame myself
 @ethanadams8109  well why do you blame yourself? And how does anything Derrick had to say resonate with you?
 @Ray03595  I see myself as too emotionally dependent and non masculine. I feel that because of that I am completely unattractive to girls and I'm going to go knowhere with them. They simply don't like the kind of person I am and it's my fault for being this way. Derrick seeming to have the same problem makes me understand him more.
" @ethanadams8109  Then you're going after the wrong kinda women. Not saying that those women are wrong, they're just not right for you. I used to be an incel too. I was just beginning to get into his kind and thankfully was pulled out by my sister and some bit of therapy.

I'm still a virgin at 25 and have never really dated anyone so by definition I'm still an incel. But now I've come to realise that there is more to life than just sex and romantic company."
" @srishti5711  I mean, good for you and I also don't need sex so much, but I definately DO need form of romantic intimacy. As I mentioned before I am VERY emotionally dependent and I struggle with anxiety. Just knowing there is someone who cares about me and will be there for me would greatly improve my mood and mental state."
 @ethanadams8109  Does it have to be a romantic partner or just having a close friend who cares and who you can confide in suffice?
" @srishti5711  Close friends can definately ease it, but a nice hug and cuddling can really do wonders and that's really awkward with guy friends, you know?"
" @ethanadams8109  the thing that is sickening and harmful about the whole ""incel"" movement is the entitlement that is expressed. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY is entitled to companionship/romance/interaction with another person. 
Any degree of interaction takes some degree of effort. Expecting others to come to only where you are comfortable is just unproductive. Masculinity and femininity have nothing to do with it. The difference is that when women do the same behavior however,  it is more accepted. this is because of society's standards and opinions (which change), and not some inherent natural occurrence."
Wasnt he in the incel video?
 @chloekim8894  yes
 @zelprimo  PREACH!!!
" @ethanadams8109  Yeah man. I understand. Ngl I'd like to have that too. All I can say is, hang in there. Anything is better than being a bitter angry incel. God bless."
" @srishti5711  I wish, but my hope is lessening every day..."
 @zelprimo  yaa i thought I recognized him haha thx!
 @ethanadams8109  I hope u stay ok man! Gl☺️ ^^
K Greenawald lol when he said he was a YouTuber that one girl looked at him with such a bad look.
" @ethanadams8109  Please don't think like that my guy. This community appeals to lonely men because they can relate to it. But I can assure you they do nothing to help you improve yourself or get a more positive outlook on life. Instead they fuel our flames of anger and frustration and push us deeper into hopelessness. Derrick is a very mild version of a true incel, or maybe he's playing nice for the camera."
 @srishti5711  So what do I do? I feel like I'm bound to be useless no matter wjat I do.
"@Ethan Hendrickson have you tried therapy? Physical exercise? Creative outlets like writing, drawing etc. this is part of the problem of toxic masculinity, being artistic is seen as being lesser than the “sporty” guys, exercising helps release endorphins in the brain which can help regulate your emotional dependency, you don’t need to work out 7 days a week for 5 hours a day but going for a light jog every other day will do wonders. Another issue of toxic masculinity is that it makes men afraid to seek help from therapists because it is seen as week to do so. A man is suppose to keep it in and hold it back. I understand that you feel lonely or lesser but I’m just curious what you have done to help yourself with that?"
" @monk3yman805  Therapy is very uncomfortable. Really doesn't do anything, but yeah, I draw a fair bit. As someone who likes anime it's almost a universal law for me to."
 @ethanadams8109  you dont wanna be that guy bro trust me gettin rejected is better than not trying. Lower your standards thats always the first step.
Lmao he started laughing while talking about empathy
 @srishti5711  💯
"Ethan Hendrickson if I may say maybe you haven’t found the right therapist. The first therapist I went to was an older white straight male who really gave this vibe of I couldn’t care less about what this young Hispanic gay man has to say. After 2 months with 2 sessions a week he just said here’s a prescription which I wasn’t in the market for. I switched to a different therapist and found a wonderful therapist that really helped me break down a lot of my issues and depression, helped come to terms with my sexuality (I was incredibly self loathing because of the rampant toxic masculinity in Mexican culture, so being gay was in my mind the worst possible thing I could be) she helped me come off the ledge and to be honest therapy is suppose to be uncomfortable. It’s suppose to make you feel what you don’t want to feel and talk about what you don’t want to talk about. I’m glad you draw! I love anime too one piece is my jam! Have you tried joining groups of artists either online or in person and trying to find other people that you can connect with that share this mutual love of drawing an anime?"
 @deezupzeohdown957  My standards are already really low. I just want a girl who is genuinely nice and kind that won't judge me. That's surprisingly hard to find.
" @ethanadams8109  As luis here pointed out, working out really helps. It takes my mind off of things and has the added benefit of getting me in shape. That will also help you feel more masculine, so to speak.

That said, don't equate being stereotypically masculine to being the best version of a man. You can enjoy cooking and it still won't make you any less of a man. 

Speaking of friends, surround yourself with people who support you and don't tear you down for being who you are.  Maybe a few female friends in your circle. They offer the kind of emotional support that men don't. An honest female friend can also tell you from an objective standpoint what you can improve in yourself. My sister told me that you have to send out positive thoughts into the world to get them back.

All these methods are meant to make you more comfortable in your own skin. Sure there are women who only go for the uber masculine. But there are also plenty who frankly don't care too much about that. No matter what, don't let them convince you that such women don't exist. I'm not saying looks don't matter. They do. But only so much. I myself had found one such partner but we couldn't keep it going because of the distance.

Lastly, stay away from these forums. They are toxic and propogate nothing but hate. And you can't hate yourself into a version of yourself you love.

I don't know who you are, where you are, what your life is like. But I can say with absolute certainty that you're not useless. Sooner or later you will find your person. Don't let a romantic disappoinment get you down. Have an open mind and put yourself out there. If there's one thing I've learnt, it's that there's someone out there for everyone. And if you don't try looking, you'll never find them."
The other two are barely sensible and all of these were bad representatives for the mens right’s movement
 @wyattrado3272  how?
james Doctor derrick was the most sensible.
"@Jeff B Yea, no...."
@Jeff B that pfp fits your comment

Hiro360 why are you on every thread?
All the men here were  showing off their misogynistic points
What is an incel?
" @jasonl9392  i was JUST thinking that, its too perfect they have to be a troll right? I can only hope.."
"Probably the same people who pay for the roads, police, etc."
" @regisglass5464  yea us, the citizens. I’m not paying for tampons out of my own pockets"
" @spookedspooks  why not? Some already pay for viagra, tampons don't seem that far fetched"
" @regisglass5464  12 billion a year, you can’t be serious."
 @spookedspooks  actually i think viagra is more than that
" @spookedspooks  yeah, i just checked. viagra is like a 2 billion dollar industry (per year) so that means in 10 years its $20,000,000,000"
" @regisglass5464  ok, so why does it make it any better to pay for tampons? You logic is horrible."
" @spookedspooks  because tampons are cheaper than viagra, and viagra is something more expensive that you didn't even know you paid for. 
In other words, why are you complaining about cost if you didn't even know you spent money?"
" @regisglass5464  dude, another 12 billion dollars? Do you not get how absurd that is for us to pay.
My point was you logic is bad, if you think it’s ok just cus we pay for another thing we shouldn’t be paying for."
" @spookedspooks   if it's absurd for us to pay that, why weren't you aware of the nearly double that you have to pay for Viagra? Doesn't seem you were paying too much if you didn't know it existed. So again, why are you complaining about cost if you didn't even know you spent money?"
"​​ @regisglass5464 , why are you suggesting even higher taxes?

Why should my tax money go to your hygiene products?

Also, viagra isn't free."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's interesting, so if Viagra isn't free but is subsidized by the government, why shouldn't the same be done with tampons?"
" @regisglass5464  men already pay more tax than vvomen. VVomen already benefit enough from taxes.

Maybe vvomen should pay more tax exclusively if they want tax for free.

Also, viagra is only subsidised for military personnel."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  that's an odd response. if men pay more than women and get products made exclusively for them at a far cheaper rate, eg, viagra is so cheap the other did not notice he pays for it, doesn't that mean tampons should be added so women have the same benefits? 
After all, if viagra is fairly cheap due to taxes, why shouldn't tampons be just as cheap?

Not sure why you pretend the military exclusively needs viagra, but doesn't this mean women in the military should also have tampons subsidized?"
"​​ @regisglass5464 Maybe vvomen should pay more taxes if they want it subsidised? I don't want my tax money going to your sanitary products.

Your arguments about tampons make no sense."
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  then i thank you for agreeing with the feminists that tampons should be government subsidized. Seems odd people think only Viagra should be paid for, agreed?"
"​​​ @regisglass5464  no, I don't agree that Viagra should be government subsidised. Not sure where you got that from.

Why should it be subsidised? List your reasons? Why should my tax money go to your sanitary products? That would be an insane amount of money.

Please kindly give your arguments as to why tampons should be subsidised."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  certainly you do. You already agreed women pay for men's Viagra and stated both should pay an equal amount of taxes. Thus, why shouldn't both get comparable benefits?
Recall that while Viagra is far more costly, the amount is so small the original commenter didn't even realize he pays for it."
" @DavidW-ng5zv   thus my statement, you graciously agreed women pay for men's Viagra and stated both should pay an equal amount of taxes. Thus, why shouldn't both get comparable benefits since women already pay for men's viagra?

And thank you for agreeing that while Viagra is more expensive than tampons, the amount is so small the original commenter didn't even realize he pays for it."
​ @regisglass5464 I don't want my tax money to go to either. Why do vvomen have to rely on men (the taxpayer) and the government? Note that women are the biggest consumers. Maybe they should try more frivolous spending instead of relying on the taxpayer to pay for their products.
"​​ @regisglass5464 men pay for their viagra.

Far more of the taxpayer's money would go to tampons than to viagra. Note that a considerable number of women require tampons.

Women shouldn't get free tampons.

We already pay enough taxes, why should we pay even more for women to get tampons?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""men pay for their viagra"" and women pay so men can have it too. As you even write that both should be treated equally, why shouldn't tampons be included so both can have the same benefits?
Recall while Viagra is more expensive than tampons, the amount paid in taxes is so small the original commenter didn't even realize he paid for it."
"​ @regisglass5464 , but viagra isn't free for men. I'm not sure where you're getting that from.

Neither tampons nor viagra should be free. We already pay enough taxes as it is.

Note that men pay more taxes than women, meaning that you expect men to subsidise women. So if men are higher tax payers, why shouldn't they get more benefits?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  correct, that is what subsidized means, that the government makes viagra cheaper. thus my statement, as you graciously agreed women pay for men's Viagra and stated both should pay an equal amount of taxes, why shouldn't both get comparable benefits, ie, subsidized tampons, since women already pay for men's viagra?

And thank you for agreeing that while Viagra is more expensive than tampons, the amount is so small the original commenter didn't even realize he pays for it."
"​​ @regisglass5464 men pay more taxes than women. Vvomen are more likely to be on government assistance than men, this means that vvomen already benefit enough from men's taxes.

Neither ampons and viagra should be subsidised, but since men pay more taxes why should they subsidise vvomen when they already do it enough in terms of welfare?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""Vvomen are more likely to be on government assistance than men""
and why do they get more government assistance?
Again, thank you for noting women pay for mens viagra and that you state they should be treated equally. In short, thank you for showing why tampons should be added."
"​ @regisglass5464 because vvomen believe that they're entitled to resources.

Thank you for admitting that vvomen already benefit from men's taxes. Men pay more taxes and vvomen receive most welfare. So why should tampons be added?"
​ @regisglass5464  why did you insult me btw?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  apologies, but you deflected. Again, what government assistance is that? Kindly write specific examples. Is it in regards to caring for children?
Regardless, thank you for noting women pay for men's viagra and that you state they should be treated equally in regards to taxes. In short, thank you for showing why tampons should be added as it seems odd only men get benefits."
"​ @regisglass5464  vvomen receive more government assistance and welfare. M en pay more taxes. 

VVomen already benefit enough from m en's taxes."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  apologies, but you deflected again. What government assistance is that? Kindly write specific examples. Is it in regards to caring for children?
But thank you for noting women pay for men's viagra and that you state they should be treated equally. Thus, thank you for showing tampons should be added as it seems odd only men get benefits."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  apologies, but you deflected again. What government assistance is it that women use? Kindly write specific examples so we may see if what you state is true.
But thank you for noting women pay for men's viagra and that you state they should be treated equally. Thus, thank you for showing tampons should be added as it seems strange only men get benefits."
 @regisglass5464  vvomen are more reliant on the government than m en are. I would appreciate it if you stopped lying.
" @DavidW-ux2gc  you deflected again. Kindly write what government assistance is it that women receive if you are not lying (though you are entitled to believe of me as you wish).
Regardless, thank you for noting women pay for men's viagra and that you state they should be treated equally. Thus, thank you for showing tampons should be added as it seems strange only men get benefits."
 @regisglass5464  i will not pay for tampon. its discrimination against men.
God... Why would anyone introduce themselves like that
Lmaoooooooooo

 @BecauseSnickers  ♡♡♡
Toxic masculinity is not real
 @gaildestiny4448  Yeah okay
" @gaildestiny4448  It is real and it hurts men more than women, just as toxic femininity is a thing that hurts women"
Femenitity?
 @Honey-ik4vd  How?? Name How??
 @putsomerespeckonmaname540  It's really not much different than toxic Feminism. Anything to an extreme and without limits is unhealthy.
Masculinity or femininity can not and will never be toxic because there's nothing toxic to begin with. A individual can have toxic traits but that doesn't derive from masculinity its from the individual themselves.
" @thebardock6785  I think it becomes toxic when in a social setting, and others feel pressured to fit into one idea of masculinity or femininity, rather than just settling with doing what they feel like, and staying as themselves. For people who get over the need to fit into whatever their local community's idea of masculinity/femininity is, they are fine, but there are a few who will change and warp themselves to an extreme either consciously or subconsciously to fit the ideals of those around them, rather than themselves which is unhealthy. 

I think that sort of mentality of there being a correct or set way of masculinity and femininity and enforcing it on others is where it becomes toxic, not the idea of someone being 'too masculine' or 'too feminine'. I don't think it means that masculinity itself is toxic, but that there are some weird mindsets in some places overly focused on the masculinity or femininity of people that are toxic."
 @arcamira7918  still nothing toxic about it and you can have both or one more than the other its totally normal. Its harmful to call these toxic traits and people boys especially are growing up not wanting anything to do with it out of fear.
nina • because if we’re being jones they aren’t going to mind their business. The whole reason we are having this video is because both sides are always getting bashed by the other especially anybody even slightly associated with MRA
Arcamira then there is not such thing as toxic masculinity or femininity. It’s just all peer pressure. It doesn’t need its own label. What is up with the past few years and needing to rename things that already have a correct term.
Mia yes

"Same here, but probably for a different reason.."
"Same, the guys were so annoying and ignorant"
 @mattalexandrescu134  The Korean looking dude wasn't really ignorant.
 @niijigod3864  yeah he seemed cool
 @mattalexandrescu134  how so?
Minecrafty012 true dat
Same and I’m only in it 2 minutes
But some of you. Need a sugar daddy app
pissedpookie LMAO
Minecrafty012 It’s not a slant. It’s reality.
Mia The men had the facts on their side and the women only had personal opinions/experiences to argue with
Why would you watch this whole thing
I started crying. The way they dismiss sexual harassment shook me
To be honest from from a guy with 2 sisters i support Derrick
8:57 wash ur hair before u come around here snickering at what other people have to say
why would he laugh at a time like this? that's so inappropriate
See how nice men are to women. The Asian dude complimented the chick saying she is “very articulate”. The one that said “I don’t have a list in front of me broooooo” 😂
Feminist definition: a person who believes in equal rights for men and women not just only women that’s it …..there’s a thin line between a feminism and pseudo feminism ppl need to understand that
"This topic can be redone now, even with the me too movement and feminism negatives on the high rise"
"ok im halfway through this, i feel like they shouldve gotten better people to talk about these topics than these 6. it feels like they kept, going back towards sort of like a sexism topic rather than the topic at hand, and none of them really brought up bigger issues that exist"
"Guy with blue shirt was the smartest on the panel. Stayed quiet but close to the end he got a little wordy challenging the girl with the white shirt. When he did argue, he was super wise in what he said and the other women approved of him too. I also feel for Alyesha and hope she gets the healing she needs, but she seemed a bit hypocritical yelling at that other guy when he asked what incidents she was referrring to, then saying when someone is hurt they need someone to listen and understand, and that she wants someone to listen and understand her. Like he wasn't challenging you to say your story wasn't real, but just wanted to know what you were talking about and you got defensive."
"I feel like should really define what feminism means, i do promote equality between genders but lot of time i hear feminist is not try to raising the women rights to a equal state, it is about surpassing men in every aspect, that's something i disagree"
Ayo those woman all disliked man's rights word
"I like how the ""incel advocate"" is the guy trying to bring up work"
derrick negated every single insane statement the women made
That didn’t land on any kind of middle ground...😮
"i don't get how men's activist keep bringing up men struggling with custody battles, but then will turn around and say women are meant to look after the children. can't keep their stories straight lol"
Do incels VS Chads next
Who said to bring the insel?
The men didn't step forward for the first prompt yet all their arguments agreed with the prompt ? they were saying how men and women are equally important but different..thats literally the prompt 😭 they only didn't step forward to be petty and undermine women
I like how one of the girls brings up the female hygiene problem but remember this can go both ways like asthma or even having to wear glasses.
Girl in white shirt brings a VERY valid point around 9:25 ish
Just the difference in the names says so much 🥴
"feminism is a movement that fights for women's rights on the basis of sex equality. it's not simply equal rights, since there'd be no reason feminism would need to exist."
"Out of curiosity, what was Alysha asked that you think she was hypocritical?"
​ @regisglass5464  she got emotional.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  and what was the question that you state made her be emotional? Or are you simply assuming she became emotional?
​ @regisglass5464  she was asked how and where the abuse from men was coming from. She then got emotional.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and what did she say about how and where men abuse women that made you assume she was emotional? Or again, why are you assuming she became emotional?"
​ @regisglass5464 she admitted to getting emotional (upset and angry).
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  If she did, then again, kindly quote what she said about where and how men abuse women. Did she answer the query?
Seems odd you avoid this"
"​​ @regisglass5464  she brought up her experiences, which were irrelevant.

If she gets upset over a simple question, then maybe she shouldn't participate."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and what experiences did she give that you state they are unrelated to the subject? Or why do you imply it was wrong she answered the MRA's question, ie, ""which were irrelevant""?"
​ @regisglass5464  because what exactly does she expect to happen? How is this going to change? Personal experiences aren't important.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  apologies, but you deflected. again, if the subject of men abusing women is unrelated to what she said, what does she say that you avoid writing it?
Seems odd answering the MRA's question is something you state was wrong."
​ @regisglass5464  he asked her a simple question and she got emotional.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus my request, which you avoid. What was her answer in regards to the subject of how and where men are abusing women?
Still odd you imply answering the MRA's question is wrong."
"​​​​ @regisglass5464  she brought up her own experiences and got emotional.

She was wrong. If she isn't, what exactly does she expect to happen?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and why is it wrong to provide personal experiences of being abused by men when the MRA specifically asks for example of how and where men abuse women?
Again, why is it wrong the MRA was answered?"
​ @regisglass5464  because why did she even bring it up? What is she even expecting to be done?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and thus my query. As we agree the MRA specifically asks for examples of how and where men abuse women, ie, he asked her a simple question, why is it wrong she answered to the point you state she became emotional? Again, was it wrong the MRA was answered when he brought up the subject?"
"​ @regisglass5464  she did become emotional, I didn't claim it. She admitted it.

Why did she even bring up harm from men in the first place?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus my question. As you stated the MRA asked her to give details about how and where men harm women, why was it incorrect he was answered?
Or again, what did she state? It is odd you avoid this query. Was the answer truly so terrible?"
"​ @regisglass5464  she claimed that all men are the problem as she supposedly experienced ""abuse."".

She got emotional."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's odd, why did you lie about what she said? I understand her examples were very upsetting, but please control your emotions.
Regardless, per your actions, thank you for showing why feminism has a point."
"​​​ @regisglass5464  I didn't lie. I repeated what she said. I'd suggest that YOU control your emotions and make an actual rational argument. Her examples aren't upsetting at all for me lol, they are for her though. 

What point does feminism have?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  certainly you did, and as you clarified her examples don't upset you, kindly write them. 
But per lying, thank you for showing feminism has a point."
"​​@regisglass5464  where did I lie or get emotional? Point out where exactly...

Why should I write out her examples when it's what she said?

You have no argument, just as the feminists in the video."
"​ @regisglass5464 , where did I lie or get emotional? Point out where exactly...

She said that men are the issue.

Why should I write out her examples when it's what she said?

You have no argument, just as the feminists in the video."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""where did I lie or get emotional?""
Thus my request. Kindly quote the feminist examples since you became emotional and lied about it. Note you even state her answer did not affect you, yet you continue avoiding the request, ie, were emotionally affect by her answer. 
Either way, thank you for showing the feminists had a point."
" @regisglass5464  why should I quote them? I gave the timestamp. She said that men are the issue. She believes that women are oppressed by men and are harmed by men. Go to 15:03.

Where did I lie about it? Where did I get emotional?

I suggest that you actually use logical arguments rather than resorting to emotional ad hominem attacks."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""where did I lie about it? Where did i get emotional?""
Hence my request. Kindly quote the examples given by the feminist since you became emotional and lied.
Either way, thank you for showing why the feminists had a point."
"​​ @regisglass5464  I gave the timestamp.

You're the one who is getting emotional and is lying."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, kindly control your emotions (as shown by you lying) and graciously quote the feminist.
Either way, thank you for accepting the feminist had a point."
"​​ @regisglass5464 , where did I lie exactly? She did believe that men are the issue as she believes that men as a group oppress women. I gave you the timestamp. 

If you're too s tupid and need me to quote it then that's your problem."
"​​ @regisglass5464 she said, ""I'm treated unfairly by the system, and a lot of the harm is coming from men.""

Does feminism believe that women are oppressed?

The only one lying is you. You keep claiming that I said that the feminist has a point, where I debunked her point."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for now showing the feminist wasn't lying. Seems odd you pretended all men are the ""system"". Please try not to be so emotional again. Now, again, would you kindly paste her examples?"
"​​​ @regisglass5464  so who does she believe runs the system? Answer my question. Does she believe that it's men or women who run it?

It's funny how you try and gaslight me by claiming that I was emotional, despite me being rational and calm this whole time. The only emotional person was the feminist in the video (which she even admitted to becoming)."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, thank you for showing you were lying. Please try not to be so emotional again. Thus, would you kindly paste her examples so you may answer your new query?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , where did I lie? I correctly stated that she views men as the issue as she believes that women are oppressed by men as a group. That's what feminism believes in. She spoke about this ""system,"" for instance. 

She got upset over a simple question. 

Do you believe that women are oppressed? If so, who are they oppressed by?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and thus my request. kindly quote her examples so you may find the answer to your query.
And again, thank you for showing you were lying. Please cease being so emotional."
"​​​ @regisglass5464 Yet, who does she believe ""oppresses"" women in the system? Is it men or women?

Isn't that the whole idea of feminism? Women are ""oppressed"" by men?

She said that the harm is coming from men.

As said, she nearly cried when asked how and where. She clearly got very emotional.

Perhaps she isn't suited to a debate being so emotional?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, thank you for showing you were lying but I at least thank you for admitting the MRA was asking details about where and how she was abused. Seems odd your emotions make you dislike him being answered, or is that why you avoid having your query answered by quoting the feminists' examples?
It seems the feminist had a point if so"
​ @regisglass5464 The feminist did say that men are the issue. Who does she believe oppresses her in the sysyem? Please note that she isn't oppressed. Women are not oppressed.
"​ @regisglass5464 , it's amazing how, when shown data and facts, you still can't admit you were wrong.

You're so set in your own beliefs."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  once again, thank you for showing you were lying, though I do thank you for admitting the MRA was asking details about where and how she was abused. Thud, kindly quote her examples to receive the answer to your query.
Seems odd her answer made you so emotional  you can't  write the answer to your query. Either way, thank you for showing the feminist had a point"
"​​ @regisglass5464  she spoke about how men touched her and threw bottles at her. She also believed that she's ""oppressed"" by this mythical patriarchy and that men are the issue."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  both men and women are the issue. We should stop the hate. Stop the gender segeration. We're not different creatures
Why are women the vast majority of those in care positions?
"Yea hypocrites lol 
What will they do with kids, hand over to their mistress so that kids would be more misreable"
"If you used your brain, you would realise that some people take the word ""equal"" to mean 'the same'. They're wrong, but if you can't figure out that the question being so vague would invite so much variety in the meaning, and instead choose to see mal-intent in their actions, you have no business contributing to the conversation."
" @labreynth  attempting to invalidate my point with over complication and insulting language doesn’t intimidate me 😅 Jubilee is for everyone to discuss that’s kind of … the whole point, even though you clearly think I’m not intellectually on par with you, pretty hypocritical of you to state I’m the one who’s misunderstanding the prompt, when you misunderstand the motive of the entire channel being open discussion."
" @flamingoxx  My point is that categorising their actions as pettiness from the beginning of the video, shows immediate bias. You can discuss whatever you want, but you'll end up representing yourself the same way these girls did, where they're clearly running with a perception of the MRA and had no intention of finding a middle ground"
so women cant have asthma or need glasses. got it
"Why shouldn't men's issues be addressed?

She's just spouting anti-male nonsense."
She’s using subjective examples to speak for an entire population.
"Alyesha is who I think of when I think of your typical feminist: A woman who's had horrible, inexcusable things done to her by men, and decides she's going to make it everyone else's problem."
"That Derrick dude is bonkers. Tbh, feminists here were bonkers too."
The lady’s(with braids) blood boiled when she spoke about the incident where a boy or guy touched her.
You should have called just pearly things
If Andrew tate would have this debate
"Personally I don't think there is a wage gap, it is just companies low balling people and men are the ones to walk out on them where as women will take the low pay"
It's so gynocentric to say it's somehow pathological for men to not be emotional the way women are. This just shows an inability to understand the other.
Also lockerroom jokes. Women do the same thing! They talk nasty stuff with eachother.
Derrick please stop
ew im sorry i just cant with derrick. zack is amazing
We don't need protection just for y'all not to hurt us hints on what the protection was for 😅
I'm so tired of the wage Gap lies.
I wish Myron Gaines was here 😂
And they just want to trp the feminist with agressive questions
"Listen, I will scream until I'm blue in the face about how women and men should be treated equally... but women discussing maculinity- toxic or not- does not sit well with me whatsoever."
16:26 he was so upset that she agreed to his answeer cause it seems like he does not advocate for equality in court room but rather just bashing on feminism
Its funny how women want men to express their feelings but instead of asking how they feel they want to tell men how men feel and why 🤣
Both sides are like children with toys.
"differentiated on gender, reuinted by hate on Derrick! Derrick solved men women fights y'all"
Wasn't what happened to her something that all women go through?
shes not making it everyone else's problem when this is a genuine thing that happens to women on the daily.
He would have destroyed them
​ @regisglass5464  feminism is wrong.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's odd, why is feminism wrong for saying men and women are equal parents? do you believe men are biologically worse parents?"
"​ @DavidW-ux2gc  that's odd, why is feminism pitting men men against women when stating both are equal parents? Again, do you believe men are biologically worse parents as the MRAs state?"
It’s just Derrick and Mimi
Zach and Bea 👑
get derrick out of here
"everyone in this debate was well read and eloquent, and then there is derrick"
Today I got introduced to incels and what that means and if Derrick is the poster boy for them then…I’m scared 😅
Derrick finally got out of the basement.
Literally Aleysha and the other girl is being ignorant to points made Mens rights and why Mens rights exist yet they dismissed that and also dismissed Kursat's stats and facts while doing no research for themselves. But NO lets just dump on Derrick who was obviously planted there by Jubilee to make one side look bad. Derrick needs help but Aleysha needs help too hope they both get it.
I have a few things to say to Derrick 🙄
I don't think you need to tell me how to have a conversation in a male locker room. Or with my male friends. The entitlement. Telling us what we can and can't talk about is insane. Stop it lol.
"Something I think not all women understand is the most common cause of death for men from 18 - 45 is taking their own life and that is a really big problem, where everyone needs to care about how women feel no one is asking how men are."
Where’s Jordan Peterson when you need him. 😂
Derricks a W
Derrick is asking why he can't get a girl friend even though he wants them to be his house wives instead of working on there carreers and he asks why he is single
16:53 there is no name....they just assume they are are......I experienced this many times.
All of these womens points are just anecdotal
"""It's already 4minutes past 11...I should just go to sleep and stop scrolling through yt ...It has been such a nice day today""
* Scrolls a bit more down *
This video :"
"16:39
I know you actually did research before coming to a constructive discussion, but my opinions are just as valid as facts, and your research is wrong"
"It's easy for people to pick on Derrick. This is probably part of why he is the way he is, just saying. I think he needs someone to help him, rather than put him in the same box he's been in, because of more bullying. I saw a lot of comments about Derrik, rather than the conversation of feminism vs mens rights. Get over Derrik already. At least he brought some comedic relief! Lol. I bet their are no actual nerds with poor social skills on this forum."
Derrick be getting on my nerves fr 6:15
Who is the head of the woman?
"I totally agree with derrick he is definitely no equal at all, he should make far less money than either men or women:.."
The feminists were so bad.
"that's an odd response. if you agree derrick is a joke, doesn't this mean you believe MRA's are the same since they agreed with Derrick?"
​ @regisglass5464  do you believe that feminism is a joke?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  do you agree with the feminists that derrick and the MRAs are wrong? Or were the MRAs correct for agreeing with derrick?
"based comment 
we should acknowledge the fact that bully incels will only make them worse.."
I believe in women's rights and lefts-masked arab 2022(he is a youtuber)
Yoo the lady without doing research went on debate it's 😅 no point
All men and women are not created equal. We advance as beings though knowledge and knowledge is power.
They always look like Derrick lol
"5:23 

You can’t protect yourself if your only defensive measure is “don’t hurt me”"
"8:23 - Something about a Men crying makes a Women look at him a little less... Just dont make it a habit.
Stop Forcing Men to be Women smh
.
.
10:47 - Thats life. Dress how you want to be address lol
12:01 - Funny how females cant stay friends but want to tell how we should operate male space."
"""why you gotta act like that"" 😂 toxic masculinity"
"There is a middle ground for this and uts humanism. Women and men and equal and not in how much they can lift or birth or etc. both the sex needs food, water, a shelter.. all the basic needs to live so why are the basic rights not applied to them equally?"
Yellow jacket broski made a more convincing argument for why we need feminism than anyone else 😂
""" I don't think you can be friends with a women"" Derrick"
Derrick is a troll.
"14:20 feminist: ""I think a lot of times when a movement is created, the other side feels like its an attack or an attempt at erasure.. feminism is not trying to do that"" proceeds to attack men's rights activism"
who invited derrick 😭
"Derrick says a ""fallen state"" but thats biblical"
So what about toxic femininity
"Idk why all of you are mad about Derrick, he had quite a few incosistencies and bad ideas but i think his traditionalist viewpoint is somewhat correct. Men and Women are different and we should acknowledge, accept that they are both fundamentally equal and both have their own roles and duties in societal harmony, overall this discussion is mostly a W, both sides presented valid arguements and tried to understand the other which is what we should do, Cheers."
"misogyny and feminism is the same, its irrelevant behavior that can turn toxic quickly!!"
"Guys I haven’t watched this yet so maybe the answer is in this video, but help me out on this; isn’t feminism fighting for equal rights? So when someone says they’re a feminist, and they are saying they want equal rights for everyone, doesn’t that also include men’s rights? I’m asking this as a feminist myself that believes that men should have rights the same way everyone else should. I assumed men’s rights is the same as being a feminist until I saw the topic of this video. I’m genuinely confused so if someone here doesn’t mind explaining how they’re different, I’d really appreciate that :)"
“I didn’t come with a list or research but I no there are some” -feminist
"If men wore skin tight or revealing clothes, they would get unwanted attention as well, just saying."
"but he didn't say men and women ""are both fundamentally equal"". he specifically said they're not equal.
So doesn't that show why people are mad at derrick?"
" @regisglass5464  Yeah, but based on one of his views, people are invalidating some other things he said, or just completely invalidating him which is inherently wrong."
" @astroadhds9407  like which ones? I mean, we already agreed he went against your main point so i'm curious what causes you to let that slide"
 @regisglass5464  It was an honest mistake on my part but I still stand firm on what I said.
" @astroadhds9407   but in regards to what other views? as far as i am aware, he only said women aren't equal to men."
" @regisglass5464  In a 24 minute video which probably had about an hour of discussion which was later shortened, you really think that's the only viewpoint of his that he mentioned?"
" @astroadhds9407  yes. that's why i am asking you what other point he gave, or are you trying to say he only appears like that because jubilee purposely made him look like that? 
Because if that's the case, then you agree everything he says is based on saying women are inferior but are now trying to say the video is a hit piece. which is weird."
" @regisglass5464  It could be but I don't want to hurl accusations,but if it was so how would I be agreeing with his opinion? I mean nowadays most of what we see is just what conglomerates and governments want us to see."
" @astroadhds9407  then why not present any of the views you say are acceptable? i mean if you are defending him and everything he says is about women being lesser, what do you think you're defending?"
​ @astroadhds9407  this Regis Glass is really bad at arguing lol. They seem confused
What valid arguments did the feminists make?
​ @regisglass5464  do you believe that men and women are equal?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  do you believe men and women are equals (as per the original commenter), or do you believe men are biologically worse parents?"
"​ @regisglass5464 If we're equal, why is feminism needed?

Are we equal in terms of physicality?

VVomen are more people-oriented. That's what the MRAs meant. That is a fact."
Me when i mix up feminism with misandrists
No they're not 😭 bfr
​ @Hat-Kid wouldn't even call them feminists ibr
Only the top 10% of men.
They needed better red pilled men
im three minutes in and i'm gonna change to another of these debates because wtf is derrick even talking about
Derrick is a really bad example of a men's rights activist
Bro why is Derrick there
"15:48 Women complaining about being flirted with or harassed and then rejecting every guy and sometimes even playing hard to get. You see? There's a very blurry line and of course men will act upon it. The problem is so much more complicated than ""men are bad"". Men are raised by mothers (often single mothers), women want men to pursue, women play hard to get, women dress provocatively and so fort. And don't get me started with evolution that made men who they are. And women saying they act wrong should complain about humanity or life itself and not just one sex."
Kudos to the feminists for keeping it together.  I would have had to excuse myself.  Wtf.
Derick is the average pokimane watcher
Next time someone tells you jubilee cares about productive debate send them this video
"3 groups : -men
                   -women 
                   -derrick"
wait did he just say  is he anti-girl scout
Derrick and the Hispanic girl gotta go yall clearly see why derrick was a bad pick but when someone asks you a question and your response is “I know you came here with your little research but I don’t have a list” that’s how you know she is just one of those people that think when they talk louder they are correct 😂
Why did you put up absolut cowards on there
"I speak on behalf of most of the sensible men out there, Derrick isn't one of us."
Idk what everyone have against derrick i mean marriage forever and church is best and even statistics say more were mote happier without Rights
why does derrick talk like an anime character?
"how do women get mad at taxes on tampons and not about taxes on first aid kits? they say tampons are nescesary, which they are, but that doesn’t mean you should just get them for free???? i’m a feminist by the way"
would love some fact-checking so people don't come away thinking that the wage gap doesn't exist just cuz you cut away there.
"What is this nonsense about women having to carefully choose what to wear when they go outside, to not draw attention??? This can be the same for guys. Weird comparison."
I know kursat must be lawyer for Walter White
MASCULINITY IS KING
Then why did all the MRAs agree with him?
dude- relax. You act like women are doing something wrong to reject someone!! That's crazy talk.
​ @angelaflorencio4542  who should pay for free tampons?
that's a strange response. in what way do men fear what type of clothes they wear?
 @regisglass5464  if m en wear certain colours at sporting events they could be a ttacked.
 @DavidW-ux2gc  what colors are those?
 @regisglass5464  if you go to Millwall in London and wear a West Ham or Chelsea shirt you'll be a ttacked...
 @DavidW-ux2gc  so you have to go to another country or state in order for said fear to materialize? what an odd fear to have.
" @DavidW-ux2gc   you are entitled to believe of me as you wish, but i asked what clothes cause men to be afraid and you mentioned sports teams from london. again, seems strange you have to go to different nations and/or cities in order to be afraid. 
Are women only afraid in certain neighborhoods or is the danger anywhere on the planet?"
" @regisglass5464  is that not an example of m en having to watch what they wear? Also, wearing the wrong colours in certain areas can get you shot.

I live in London.

Also, m en are far more likely to be victims of violent crimes than vvomen are. M en get attacked every day."
" @regisglass5464  is that not an example of m en having to watch what they wear? I live in London, so I was giving an example.

Also, m en are far more likely to be victims of violent crimes than vvomen are. M en get attacked every day."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  that's interesting, you changed the subject to being attacked for money. Is this because you stated you live in London yet have to go to Bermondsey in order to be attacked for what you wear? truly an odd fear to have.
If men are more likely to be attacked, then why did you imply through your deflection that only women are attacked over their clothes?"
" @regisglass5464  what are you talking about? I was giving an example. It could happen at any football match. You don't even know what Bermondsey is.

Where did I say anything about being attacked for money? What even are you talking about?

Men are more likely to be attacked. Statistics show that.

I said that men are attacked for their clothes and other things. Learn how to read."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  so it is in Bermondsey. Thank you for clarifying that. So again, as you changed the subject to being attacked for ""other things"", is this because you have to go to a football club in Bermondsey to be attacked for what you wear? 

Again, if men are more likely to be attacked, why did you imply through your subject change that only women are attacked over their clothes? Seems women are more likely to be attacked if so."
" @regisglass5464  so you admit that you do not know what Bermondsey is? Thank you clearing that up. Just a hint: It's not a person.

I was giving an example. Many football fans have been attacked over the clothes that wear all around the world, not just during games. Some have even been k illed.

I never said that vvomen are attacked over their clothes. The statistics show that the majority of violent crime victims are MEN."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  note you backtrack so much you now state women aren't worried over being attacked due to their clothing choices. Again, is this because you noticed that saying men are afraid of being attacked at a football club in bermondsey means men aren't afraid their clothing choices will instigate crimes too?"
" @regisglass5464  you are just lying now. I never said that.

Men's clothing choices can lead to them being attacked. I gave an example of when it can happen..."
"​ @DavidW-ux2gc precisely, you wrote of a football club in bermondsey. Thus, again, as you backtrack from writing about being attacked per clothing choices, is this per believing women are more likely to be attacked?"
" @regisglass5464  because I was giving an example. Men get attacked for what they are wearing every day. They also need to watch what they wear.

M en are more likely to be attacked than vvomen..."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  thus my statement. Again, note your backtracking from stating men are attacked over their clothes to stating men suffer more violent crime in general. 
So is your backtracking per believing more women are attacked as you have to compare all crime with women being attacked over their clothes? Are women only afraid in certain neighborhoods (as you wrote men are per your example) or is the danger anywhere on the planet?"
" @regisglass5464  where did I backtrack? You asked for examples of when men need to watch what they wear and I gave you one.

More men are victims of violent crime than vvomen, they are attacked more. 

It's interesting that you believe that men can't be victims."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  again, seems odd you wrote men must go to another state or country in order to be in danger over clothes, don't you agree? Or is the danger for women over clothes found anywhere on the planet?"
" @regisglass5464  I was using an example, it can happen to men anywhere. However, if you believe that men never get attacked or have to watch what they wear and can wear whatever they like at all times, then you are free to do so."
"​ @DavidW-ux2gc   do you then believe men fear the actions of sports clubs in every part of the world? or what other example is there that means men ""have to watch what they wear and can wear whatever they like at all times""?
if no other example exists, then it seems odd you state men must go to other parts of the world in order to fear what clothes they wear."
"​ @regisglass5464 Yes, it can be anywhere in the world.

If men are the majority of violent crime victims. You don't think that what they might need to watch what they wear?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""Yes, it can be anywhere in the world.""
then you are entitled to pretend every corner of the world is attacking men due to the influence of football clubs. 
But per doing so, thank you for showing men don't fear the type of clothes they wear."
​ @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for now backtracking again. Still seems odd you believe men have to go to specific states or cities in order to feel said fear.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, you are entitled to pretend every corner of the world is attacking men due to the influence of football clubs and gangs. but i thank you for noting why only women fear drawing attention as per their clothes"
 @regisglass5464  I never backtracked. I gave an example of when men need to watch what they wear. There are other examples.
" @regisglass5464  I was giving examples. Men are far more likely to be victims of violent crime, so they do have to watch what they wear."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""victims of violent crime"" again, thank you for backtracking, or do you now write of violent crime in general because men don't have to be worried about what they wear?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  and again, you are entitled to pretend every corner of the world is attacking men due to the influence of football clubs and gangs. still odd you believe men have to go to other nations or cities in order to have said fear."
 @regisglass5464  Men are more likely to be attacked over what they wear.
" @DavidW-ux2gc  thus my statement. Per your examples, you are entitled to believe every corner of the world is attacking men due to the influence of football clubs"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and as i stated per your example (before backtracking), you are entitled to believe every corner of the world is attacking men due to the influence of football clubs"
​ @DavidW-ng5zv     nnen are more likely to be attacked and victims of violence by... who?
Cant put into words how obnoxious Mimi is 😂
Very convenient for the producers to include an expert in the men’s team. Just saying.
Derrick is the worst person you coulda invited 💀😊
Derrick is an incel activist and I can imagine just why
don't let that BOTHER you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! triggered!
"All these traits described as ""toxic masculinty"" is not masculinity, its immaturity"
"Kursat, Zach and Bea are the most reasonable people there."
"Derrick was ridiculous. Mimi pissed me off. Zach, Bea, and Kursat were the most reasonable."
Dude in the green shirt said men should be treated equally in family court but also said that women are the better nurturers and men shouldn't be midwives. Those two thoughts seem to contradict each other.
"🤦🏾‍♂️ ""i dont need you to protect me, i need you not to harm me "".. 
""I can protect myself"".
Soo then why are you complaining?"
Where's this woman getting HER little facts from?
If ever there was an ambassador for being an incel 😂
Why is there always a derrik in every middle ground
Ok so to understand Derrick firstly you wanna take 2 shots of tequila then another 2 shots then another...... Afted 636 shots of tequila you will understand everything he says.
"16:25 i love this feminist, blames the guy because he came prepared for a debate 🤣
This girls must think we men have invisibility coats or something, i don´t fell safe at night in the streets either probably not for the same reasons but men face more violence in general when it comes to crimes and yes it´s probably from another men but i don´t blame men for that, it´s not patriarchy, just bad people walking this earth."
Derrick never touched a woman 😅😂
"13:54 it’s because they’re not blackpilled
13:59"
Wow apparently men have no bad experiences.
Not a lot of rings in this group lol
Idk but zach is the most chad guy
aren't all those traits about telling women they aren't equal to men?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for showing why it's called toxic masculinity
" @regisglass5464  toxic masculinity isn't real.

How exactly are men and women equal?"
 @DavidW-ux2gc  then are women equal to men if toxic masculinity isn't real?
​ @regisglass5464  so how are men and women equal exactly?
 @DavidW-ux2gc men having to be leaders and always being stoic and strong CAN be toxic and masculine traits. This hurts men and women
⁠ @DavidW-ux2gc we aren’t talking about equality in physical strength we are talking about equal meaning equal in the fact they are both human and deserving of the same rights
We already have the same rights. @Parrallaxatives 
 @DavidW-ux2gc  what is the meaning of masculinity then?
AGREE.
"Would be interested in one with just those 3, I wonder how just having actually reasonable people would make a difference"
Women biologically being made for nurturing is not an argument against men being treated fairly in family court
"What an odd statement. If people can protect themselves, then why would they be happy that some random individuals assault them?"
@regisglass5464  nah whats odd is telling the person looking to protect you that he's harming you. By caring enough to want to protect you from people that ACTUALLY want to hurt you. Thats odd.
 @shaunbuckley304  that's an odder answer. You mean derrick is going to protect them?
 @regisglass5464  uh huh sure whatever you say
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for noting incels do commit mass shootings over their views. Clearly, we need them to not harm others, agreed?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , do you think that all men who can't get laid will commit mass shootings?"
 @DavidW-ng5zv  would you like to write the views incels hold that influence their mass shootings? Or do you believe all men are like Elliott Rodgers?
"you wrote ""probably not for the same reasons"". what different reasons do women have to fear walking at night?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , what do you think feminism can do to prevent women from fearing walking home at night?"
 @DavidW-ng5zv  prevent what? What are women afraid of happening when they walk at night?
​ @regisglass5464  you tell me. You're the self-confessed feminist.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  you are entitled to believe of me as you wish. However, I cannot answer until you graciously specify what women fear will happen to them when they walk home at night. Is it something based upon the patriarchy that you suddenly said I'm a feminist?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , the patriarchy doesn't exist anymore. 

Women are afraid of being attacked walking home. Are you happy now?

Please note that we no longer live in a patriarchy."
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  apologies, but you're backtracking. Again, you kindly agreed women fear something men generally don't. Upon me asking what it is, you immediately stated I'm a feminist. Would you write what said attacks are if simply mentioning it mean you're a feminist? Would doing so mean you agree a patriarchy exists?"
"​​ @regisglass5464  the patriarchy doesn't exist.

Women say that they fear being attacked on the way home. This is usually SA."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and what is SA? Seems odd something that affects women so much is something you can't name. Again, you stated me simply mentioning makes it feminist, so doesn't that mean the patriarchy exists?"
​ @regisglass5464  patriarchy doesn’t exist.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  then kindly write what SA is. Seems odd you believe me merely asking what that is means you defensively state the patriarchy isn't real.
​ @regisglass5464  it is s exual a ssault.
"I don't like the arrogance that derrick shows with his mannerisms and movements, I feel like it's a big NO in a place where people are trying to discuss and have a genuine conversation about a sensitive topic. Although I am for Men's rights, it seems like it's 2 men and 1 boy vs 3 feminists."
How come nobody in America has a discussion about the replacement rate. If every couple doesn't have 2 children to replace themselves then the population will go into decline. It's up to women. If they continue to not want children then our country will cease to exist.
She thinks only men get upset when theyndont give out there number...  you should see what happens when a girl makes the first.move and then is rejected.. many dont take it well.
I'm getting a really clear idea why Derrick's an incel....
"despite the fact that Derrick was raised by a single mother he acted as if he had a fatgher figure in his life
he is strong, confident and thinks logical, people really are dead nowadays
PRAISE Derrick"
Bro just threw Derrick into it because why not
I don’t understand why Derrick is here. He comes off as an edgy teenage boy that’s been rejected by his crush. Whereas everyone else is having an adult conversation and trying to understand each other.
Ahh yes bringing two major problems of society and making them have a conversation what could go wrong.
"..bruh does she not know that men want to walk around everywhere with no pants all the time..? 
“Never have to think about what they’re wearing” lol"
Men generally dont carry victimization on their shoulders lls but we definitely have our own issues
You can see how nervous the men are to speak about the truth for fear of being called sexist
"Genuine question, is Derrick on the spectrum?"
This was a very productive dialogue minus Derrick.
zach just like me frfr
I feel  I feel  o feel  grow up people it's harder in the real world 😅😅😅😅😅
Derrick is a reddit mod..😂😂
"Derrick has definitely been rejected by a woman that he really loved, which is why he keeps associating crying with being weak ESPECIALLY infront of a woman. Hes definitely hurt"
i like derrick
I am a feminist but i find myself agreeing with the asian guy
Coulda done without Derrick tho
"If they aren’t saying something sexist, why would anyone care?"
What truth? Comparing women to children sounds pretty sexist to me.
Fatherless behaviour...
derrick had some valid points surprisingly
the way the guy in the blue shirt scoffed at the toxic masculinity prompt is evidence of the truth in the prompt
Kursat i love you even tho im not gay
Not all men are bad people.
this girl couldn't even mention the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women.
Men's rights vs Feminism (Derrick is also here)
"16:43 “I didn’t come with a list” 16:45 “Just One”
She got caught up. 😂🤷‍♂️😂 The Feminist Bae was actually the only one up there with knowledge and without a chip on her shoulder. I am still waiting on that answer for the court system tho! 🤔"
"The ladies ignore obvious discrimination questions in the workplace and instead focus on ""this is men telling me what to wear""... ffs ladies, are you completely unwilling to even talk to these guys? You see where that is going.... 😊"
Im extremely disappointed about the lack systematic inequalities. Such as men having to sign up for selective service. There’s not many at all but there are legal advantages that women have that men don’t.
Derrick is wise
"Honestly, Mimi is pretty wrong on her view of mens rights being an offensive factor considering womens rights were being supported about 10 years earlier than mens rights. Though the goals of the group have changed, now womens rights are mostly on the offensive side whilst mens rights are not given much room to breathe and fight for some nessesary rights.

Basically mens rights nowadays is just there to defend from claims in womens rights now."
"if the only way you can protect yourself is other people not trying to harm you, you cannot protect yourself. 5:09"
8:59 and these are things women GREATLY contribute to it. Jfl at that virtue signaling in the end
Both sides need to just grow up and live life it's not going to be a safe place for everyone in the world just live and let live quit acting like victims so much the youth are such crybabies. Every one is taxed on most of everything. Omg it's just they want  handouts and no one is allowed to be offered.
"If the women are willing to be responsible and accountable, then they can be labeled as adults. If they reject this responsibility and accountability, they are children. Adulthood goes hand in hand with responsibility and accountability."
UNforutnatly had to stop watching video the kid anoyed me and that 1 defensive chick.
Derrick is the reason why people dont believe in men's rights.
Wait what 🤨 I don't need you to protect me i need you to just not harm me but i can protect my self my brain is damaged
16:21 best moment
"I want all of the privileges and none of the accountability and bye the way I don't know what I want."" Says feminist"
My head hurts rn
Because it isn't real.
"pretty much, not to mention his view that men are biologically lesser parents"
 @regisglass5464  toxic masculinity doesn't exist.
"​ @regisglass5464  they didn't. They said that they're different. 

Are men physically stronger than women?"
Tell that to Regis Glass and other feminists.
"Not all women are bad either
 yet y'all act like we are"
 @jan6742   what? lol
"agreed, and only feminists help men and women. thus far, mra's state men are inherently bad parents."
​ @DavidW-ng5zv that's strange. Why would saying men and women are equal parents mean men are hate?
"He asked what feminist entity helps challenge bias against men in the family court system and instigated any meaningful change in the law. The question required a hyper specific answer so it was pretty unfair.
Ironically, no MRA movement has ever done anything to help fathers because the general MRA position is to say men are biologically lesser parents."
"you can see NOMAS if you want. also, the MRA's kept saying men were lesser parents while the feminists disagreed"
​ @regisglass5464  NOMAS haven't done anything for men.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for noticing kursat was mistaken. Thus, how do the MRAs help men by saying men are lesser parents?"
​ @regisglass5464 Kursat was correct when he said that there are no feminist organisations that help men.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, thank you for noticing kursat was mistaken. Do you avoid writing of any MRA organization that helps people because they only state men are lesser parents?"
" @regisglass5464  Kursat was correct, there are no feminist organisations that help men. You can't even name any.

A Voice for M en and Fathers 4 Justice all help. They raise awareness of important m en's issues."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  you are entitled to pretend otherwise. But if the groups you named help anyone, why do they specifically say in their donation box that the money does not go to help men?"
" @regisglass5464  they raise awareness for men's issues. Why are you against m en's issues being addressed?

Also, there are no feminist groups that do help m en. If there are, what have they done for m en?

Is feminism teaching vvomen to hate m en helpful?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  thank you for agreeing none of the groups you named donate to men in trouble. Thus, thank you for showing why only feminists help and noting the group that helps them."
" @regisglass5464  but there are no feminist groups that help men. If there are, list what they do.

Also, MRA groups do bring attention to men's issues. Why are you against men's issues being discussed?"
" @regisglass5464  also, if you want to lie about me, I suggest that we meet up and deal with this in person like men. I'll happily fight you."
" @regisglass5464  interesting how you've edited your comment as you don't want to fight.

Feminism doesn't help men. Why are you so keen to lie about it?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  you are welcome to believe of me as you wish. But again, thank you for agreeing none of the groups you named help men, ie, proving why only feminists help"
"​ @regisglass5464 , you haven't mentioned anything that feminists have done for men. Name some examples. 

I'm not an MRA, but I'd much rather them than feminists when it comes to men's issues. At least they understand men."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, thank you for noting kursat was mistaken and thank you for noticing none of your examples help men"
"​ @regisglass5464 , where was he mistaken? Please don't lie. He correctly stated that there are no feminist organisations that help men.

My examples bring attention to men's issues and don't spread hatred of men, the latter of which is what feminists do.

You haven't even given any examples of feminism helping men."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  you are welcome to backtrack, but thank you for noting kursat was mistaken and thank you for noticing none of your examples help men.
You are entitled to pretend that organizations pocketing money helps men"
"​ @regisglass5464 , but you haven't given any examples of feminism helping men. Name one thing that feminism has done. NOMAS is an organisation for vvomen, it even says so on their site.

MRAs at least help men from anti-male nonsense spread by feminism."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, thank you for backtracking per noting kursat was mistaken and thank you for noticing none of your examples help since you admit they pocket the money sent to them.
Would you like to wrote what NOMAS is an acronym for if it is an organization for women? But thank you for noting they are not like MRA's"
 @DavidW-ng5zv  they can’t because there are none.
What does selective service do?
Women pay a pink tax for the exact same hygiene products as men use and on top of that tampons and pads should not be something that comes out of a women’s pockets especially since it’s a medical necessity. You should here the horror stories of poor young girls coming to school with make shift pads that fail because they can’t afford them
​​ @Parrallaxatives  boohoo. It's women's fault.
"age determines if you are an adult or a child, what you wrote here didnt make any sense and I have no idea what part of the video youre refering to"
the fact that all the other MRA's agreed with him is the other reason.
 @regisglass5464 i feel like they were just trying to defend their cause. it would have been a reasonable conversation if derrick wasn't there.
i agree with both sides. i believe that everyone should be treated equally
 @QueenMagenta-sv7fr  dude if you believe people should be treated equally then you automatically disagree with the MRAs.
​ @DavidW-ux2gc that's an odd statement. What law exists that state women can assault men?
" @DavidW-ng5zv exactly my query. again, if you believe women are permitted to assault men, what law states so? Are the police impeded from taking women to jail for assault?"
​ @regisglass5464  The Violence Against Women Act.
 @regisglass5464  the Violence Against Women Act.
 @DavidW-ux2gc  that's an odd response. Why do you believe women being defended from assault means men are not? Seems odd you deflect from my query in writing what law legalized violence against men
​ @regisglass5464  because it means that men are always treated as the aggressors and women the protected class.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's an odder response. As you accepted the law you wrote is about women being defended from assault, why do you then believe it's not women attacking other women? For example, is it not generally men who attack other men?"
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv that's interesting, you backtracked. As you now state laws against women being assaulted means women attack men, is that you accepting you made a mistake?
Or again, why did you automatically assume violence against women includes men? Is it not women who generally attack women like it's men who generally attack men?"
 @regisglass5464  why do women use the Act as an excuse to attack men as they know that the law will be on their side?
" @DavidW-ux2gc  thank you for backtracking from stating the law condones attacks. Thus i reiterate, why did you assume violence against women includes men that you state laws are being abused in that way?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  thank you for thus backtracking upon noting your mistake in stating rape laws don't include men, ie, noting men and women are equals. or why not quote it?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  likewise, thank you for accepting no law condones violence against men. thus, again, why did you associate violence with men?"
"​ @regisglass5464  then why does the Violence Against Women Act only protect women?

Why are women allowed to attack men often with impunity? Please note that studies show this. Answer my questions."
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  ""why does the Violence Against Women Act only protect women""
excellent question. Thus i reiterate, why did you assume violence against women includes men that you state laws are being abused in that way? Do women not attack other women?"
​ @regisglass5464 Why is violence against men okay according to feminism?
" @DavidW-ng5zv   apologies but you deflected. Again, per writing ""why does the Violence Against Women Act only protect women"", why did you immediately assume violence against women includes men? 
Bu thank you for accepting your mistake about the law."
"​ @regisglass5464 , so why is there no Violence Against Men Act?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  excellent question. Allow me to answer that with a similar query to the one you avoid. 
As you immediately assumed the ""violence against women act"" involved men, is this similar to implying that violence against men overwhelmingly involves women? 
But again, thank you for accepting your mistake"
"​​ @regisglass5464  just answer my question, why is there no Violence Against Men Act if men are the majority of violent crime victims?

Why is violence against men acceptable in your view?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  i am answering your query. I am just doing it with the query you avoid. Thus i reiterate: 
As you immediately assumed the ""violence against women act"" involved men, does this mean you believe violence against men inherently involves women? 
Again, thank you for accepting your mistake"
"​ @regisglass5464  Violence against men comes from both men and women.

Why aren't men who are victims of assault by women taken seriously? Why can women abuse men with little consequences?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and thus my query. I will reiterate as you avoid your answer:
As you immediately assumed the ""violence against women act"" involves men, does this mean you believe violence against men inherently involves women? Seems odd you avoid an answer to your query"
"​ @regisglass5464 Violence against men comes from both genders. 

Why do you believe that violence against men isn't an issue?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus my question which you avoid. Again, as you automatically assumed violence against women includes men, does this mean violence against men inherently includes women? 
Or if you wish to be even more direct, do you believe women are just as strong as men? Still odd you avoid an answer to your query."
WOMEN ☕
There’s a difference between helping someone in need and acting like a person is incapable of doing anything without a bodyguard present.
Thanks
derrick is too arrogant acting like he better than everyone someone needs to humble him. he was raised by a single mum he should know better. derick actually pisses me off
"Quite patronizing to say ""I'm not invalidating, I'm just asking how and why?"" When she's told you already."
Zach is a chad
"Toxic masculinity is using poor emotional regulation techniques to control, intimidate, hurt others and yourself  - including other men. Positive masculinity is using high emotional intelligence, self regulation to have a positive impact on yourself and others. Derrick is insecure, unregulated and frankly, weak. Note that emotions include anger - an emotion men are often very comfortable demonstrating"
"If 'there are X' then you HAVE to give at least one name lol Its not a question of having a list or a ""ReSeArCh"". You're saying there are X, then provide example."
"As a female welder i feel like the dude in yellow would lose it working with a woman in the field
Lol"
Derrick be getting on my nerves fr
What is Derrick doing there
“Men’s rights” 💀
There’s sales tax on toilet paper and toothbrushes. I’m not whining.
"I love how the word ""misandry"" was never brought up. Not once. Half of the problems these guys are talking about are because of misandry, not feminism. Way to drop the freaking ball."
"i think everyone agrees derrick is ruining this entire video, and i desperately want to sit down and talk with everyone here"
bro 30 seconds into derrick talking I can already tell this kid is not going places except maybe jail
Derrick is based
Alyssa's too emotional for a proper debate.
I wonder where all six of them are in 2024 and How is their love life going 🤔?
"It’s hard to say, because I know, editing by definition interrupts the chronology, but I really feel like the feminist and the two non-Dereks could’ve had a much more useful conversation without you know… Derek"
"instead of people to appreciate Jubilees strive for some type of ideological diversity in their debates, They jump to accuse and derail Derrick for his opinions. And even if you might not agree, the reason you dont like Derrick is because of his label as an incel or his appearance."
"When the yellow jacket guy said ""Marxism (?)"" He showed that he posessed absolutely zero knowledge about both Feminism and Marxism."
WHAT IS Derrick 🤣🤣
Toxic masculinity isn't real.
"​ @GabrielCain28  no, it's not."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  why
Your comment is somewhat sexist
 @DavidW-ng5zv  so you might say like masculinity have both advantages and disadvantages and there is not such thing as toxic masculinity??
" @NerdinessD  yes, there is no such thing. Masculinity either is or it isn't.

Why would we want feminists talking about masculinity?"
"There is alot of misandry in feminist movement, always has been."
"Im not gonna say nothing except are these dudes for real? Props to the ladies, they were awesome. well-spoken and assertive."
I don’t think Mimi or Derrick came here to find a middle ground
Derrick talking about children and comparing to women…..
"I believe the Asian Macaulay Culkin is simply too young to understand a lot of the issues those women are bringing up.
Some knowledge and empathy comes with time."
The feminists gaslighting during the whole show 😂😂
Just because Derrick had a hard time getting his point of view out doesn't make him all these shitty things everyone is saying! He had very valid points when it was just one on one. People can be so rude! Do we always have to pick one person to put down!?!?!?
"Derrick is ignorant. He keeps saying traditional. And there is a reason we MOVED away from traditional. Woman couldn’t work. Couldn’t have bank accounts, I think what is lost in translation is this NEW feminist movement. However the other two guys listened and they did try to understand and asked questions. Derrick just pissed me off."
Bolth sides are wrong here
Why do they all look 14?
I feel bad for Zach tbh
this was so close to being a great debate before they added the clownshow
"Derrick has the energy of a follower who jumped on the bandwagon due to mass amounts of rejection. Don’t like his energy at all.

Zach gives the energy of “ my mother  was docile towards my dad so I grew up in this reality” kinda energy.  

The other guy: blah…"
This is causing division.
"No because when he mentioned how Boy Scouts should only be for boys I got mad. When I was little I joined Boy Scouts because the Girl Scouts in my opinion at that time was not fun, but the Boy Scouts literally had everything that was cool. I hate that he said that"
5:12 keep that same energy in a dangerous situation.
L Derrick. Bro is hurt the pretty cashier rejected him
There’s woman locker room talk too. Seems one sided
"Now, do toxic femininity."
I can see why Derick is an incel😐😐😐
Derrick insinuating that women are inferior to men when he's literally at the bottom of the pyramid is insane.
what examples?
How??
When?
 @CeeC_230  when they tried to downplay men's issues by trying to put a feminist lens on it.
​ @DavidW-ux2gc when?? I thought they were standing up for men's rights during the toxic masculinity prompt
" @JsfosstdjsfJsfos-lf4tg  the feminists never stood up for men's rights lmao. What are you talking about?

Also, masculinity isn't toxic. Feminism is toxic."
" @DavidW-ux2gc sorry but I think both feminism and masculinity can be toxic. If you take something, it will have both pros and cons. I feel like you are being a lot like Derrick in the video.😅"
Didn't he say women aren't equal to men and then compare women to children?
​ @regisglass5464  so what?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for showing exactly why feminism is needed
"​ @regisglass5464 , why is it needed? What is it going to do?

Useless movement"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, thank you for showing exactly why feminism is needed"
​ @regisglass5464 How? What is feminism going to do?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  who is more likely to be fair: a jury that sees the sexes as equals or a jury that sees men as inherently worse at parenting than women?
"​ @regisglass5464 The sexes aren't equals, so it's a moot point.

Again, what is feminism going to do?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus, thank you for accepting only feminism helps both sexes."
 @regisglass5464  how exactly has feminism helped me as a m an? I want to know exactly where feminism has helped me in my life.
 @DavidW-ux2gc  should there be equality between the sexes?
 @regisglass5464  define equality. We already have equal rights...
" @DavidW-ux2gc  thus my previous question: ""who is more likely to be fair: a jury that sees the sexes as equals or a jury that sees men as inherently worse at parenting than women?"""
 @regisglass5464  how are the sexes equal exactly?
" @DavidW-ux2gc  hence my previous question: ""who is more likely to be fair: a jury that sees the sexes as equals or a jury that sees men as inherently worse at parenting than women?""
Seems odd you avoid this."
" @regisglass5464  if equality does not exist, how can it be implemented?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  thus my query: 
""who is more likely to be fair: a jury that sees the sexes as equals or a jury that sees men as inherently worse at parenting than women?""
Do you avoid answering this query because it answers your doubts?"
"​ @regisglass5464  again, it's a moot question. If something doesn't exist, how can a jury implement it?

Why do men get harsher sentences for the same crimes?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , if something doesn't exist, how can it be implemented?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus the query you avoid: 
""who is more likely to be fair: a jury that sees the sexes as equals or a jury that sees men as inherently worse at parenting than women?"""
" @regisglass5464  if men and women are not equal, how can it be implemented? I cannot answer until you have answered that."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  hence the query you avoid: 
""who is more likely to be fair: a jury that sees the sexes as equals or a jury that sees men as inherently worse at parenting than women?"" Or is one something that can never exist?
Do you avoid this query because you dislike that it shows feminism has a point?"
 @DavidW-ux2gc  there might be difference between us but that won't stop us from our choises on who we become. I do know complete representation and equal pay is impossible
They are literally the same
Exactly these 304s
Exactly I don't what point she ewwas trying to make but it was so flawed
"I came back to this because of the statement ""I don't need you to protect me, I need you to not harm me""
So so powerful and scary as it reflects the reality."
Derrick.... BROOOOO hahahah
Derrick is a discord mod 😂😂😂
Derrick is soooooo a discord Mod hahaha
What did Kursat say? 😂
"My favorite part of this is when one of the women accused the men of “sounding angry” when making their points, then immediately after got overly emotional and angry during the discussion."
12:05 eye roll
i feel like the females had a very hard time making it sound like they weren’t blaming men. i found that a lot of their statements have background agendas
"""I KNOW YOU CAME WITH UR LITTLE RESEARCH OR WHATEVER..."" 
That's enough for me, girl, that's enough, the hypocrisy you showed in this video is incredible, made just to stop the video, see ya"
15:15 Bro wdym...OBVIOUSLY EVERYWHERE....
"at this point 9:10, she actually mentioned the facts which often people overlook at and are afraid but i damn salute her being so accurate and saying it on point when men here specifically are doing nothing for men's rights except justifying and trying to wrong the other side specially Derrick. Also the way derrick look at the woman telling their stories and gives a sly smile seems so insensitive and i love how in last alyshea pointed out and the fact he was laughing on how women actually suffered, when ironically he was raised by his single mother. I can feel my blood boil just listening to his baseless conversation"
The viewpoint grounded in facts over feelings will always prevail. The crazy part is everyone knows who I'm referring to
"It's not fair fight to compete a debate  between homeboy,introverted,socially inept men vs loud,obnoxious,alpha feminist women"
all these women described low or no masculinity not toxic masculinity
"As a young adult male, 
I have a great and sincere respect for women and I would like to develop a healthy and relationship with a beautiful young woman but sometimes I don't know my limits and sometimes I push my luck and to be honest, I've pushed my luck before after I met a beautiful young woman on a dating website and then after seeing her in person more than once, I was hoping that she and I would develop a healthy relationship but she made it clear and wanted to be friends and after I realized that I was pushing my luck too much, that's when I've decided to stop, think and wait and pray more and see what happens. She may change her mind in the future. But until that happens, I have to wait it out more and be respectful towards her and not make her feel uncomfortable."
"who tf let derrick in this mf
















."
"Imagine a member of armed forces crying. They could be fired. Sometimes, or most times, we (men and women) should learn to not be emotional. That makes you vulnerable. This is not written to offend anyone, as it is just a personal view. Goodbye."
"Unlike Derrick, most people who support men’s rights do not look down on women."
Poor Zac
"The lady “Mimi” says “I don’t need protection, I can protect myself”….. are you sure? Serious question."
"Wrong.  He was trying to deflect by challenging her to produce a list on the spot, and wouldn’t back off the first time when she said she didn’t have one prepared."
 @AP-wy2ni  ??? =)))))
" @AP-wy2ni  so? How am i wrong? xD
Cuz, my friend, last time when i checked,  she was talking about dissmisal, then when he questioning her about that big research, she just dissmised the guy, what are u talking about?"
"Her ""arguments"" were a joke, and she was made to look ridiculous later on."
I guess it depends on your definition of masculinity. But there are sadly people who think being forceful and suppressing emotions is what makes someone masculine.
"You're not part of the armed forces 

And they all cry when no one's looking"
Who do you think women need protection from? Serious question.
 @valismss   a lot of things. Including men.
4 years of hating on derrick 😂
Get derrick out of here
kursat 🔛🔝
You guys should do Israelites verse Christians
mans literally referred to himself as an incel... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
"Not Derrick saying that things were better and happier in the 1950s when people ""got married and stayed married and had families and went to church"" as if ""excessively ambitious"" women during that time weren't lobotomized or given tranquilizers to make them more docile."
People need to stop confusing human rights for a sort of gender activism
Just when the men activist are about to make a point...Derrick open his mouth and they lost the argument.
Bro there smug looks are so obvious 😭😂
Theres no worse choice for this panel than Derrick. Check his hard drive and watch him. These incel types can quickly lead to a certain type of violence.
Look at 0:57 first thing she says is she starts laughing imagine anyone said the abt blm
i want top g on this
All i here from them 17:24 is its all men fault that litterly all they are saying 😭
yo aleysha leme holla at you shawty run along now
18:14 mans can’t be real he’s gotta be joking
0:56 the fact that she thinks men's rights are just jokes is actually concerning
I wish they talked about the draft. If they truly want equal rights they would be drafted as well.
The men missed so many points
When the Incel is the voice of reason🗿🚬
I don’t understand this whole let’s fight on who’s better. Why can’t we just agree we’re different and it’s not a bad thing. We compliment each other and need each other. It’s ok to be different we’re all different there are no two same men or women. I just don’t get why it’s so hard to understand that men and women are different.
Who the freak are you
he;s an incel
"also, in the 1950s, viruses like Rabies were practically a death sentence if you got it, so the 1950s were not better at all"
The MRAs were far more convincing.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  I'm a pro MRAs definitely but there is some bad apple that make us look bad.
 @aguirrechronicles  the feminist movement is bad. These ones were a prime example.
The part that most annoys me is that the MRAs agree with derrick. The feminists had a point when they said they weren't sure why the MRAs existed.
"​ @regisglass5464 , why would that annoy you?

If vvomen have a group for them, why shouldn't men have their own?"
"out of curiosity, what have mra's done to help men? because the mra's in the video said men are discriminated in family courts only to then immediately say men are inherently worse parents."
or no one be drafted?
Nobody is arguing that men and women are different. Every individual is different. It’s a matter of being able to have the same opportunities and freedoms.
" @JROC81686  exactly, people say we aren't equal today which isn't true at all. in this day and age we all have so many opportunities that it's making people spoiled in a way."
 @lornam1142  what opportunities do people not have?
 @JROC81686  People have certain biases that prevent others from being able to live their best lives.
I wouldn't mind seeing farmers/hunters vs vegetarians/vegans.
do this again but without the derrick guy. he raised no legitimate arguments
9:10 But when a boy asks a girl she will reject him and he will cry and then girls will burst to laughter and he will want to end his life. Thats the livespan of a teenage boy
derrick admitting that he’s an incel proudly is actually insane to me
Derrick being able to destroy all of them 💀
I think it's an insult for those two men to be sitting alongside Derrick. He can't make any valid arguments.
"Y'all in the comments are ignoring Kurasat too much for my liking. He's like a Ben Shapiro copy. He couldn't name one specific actual thing that men's rights activists advocate for. ""Disparity in the education system,"" and ""criminal justice system,"" like what exactly bruv? Its crazy also how much these women talk so much about how much they would advocate for men but the other side never said the same."
Yall giving way to much credit to Zach 😭
Should have let Kursat speak more
Why are people going full sheep mode on Derrick?
derrick comes across as such a disgusting person
Sucks that she had those issues but men also men are victims of those same types of things and they get less support.
Where’s toxic feminism
"Their expectations r literally JUST from america,, we WOC r fighting for our lives 💀💀"
"""Involuntarily Celibate"" sure *Involuntarily*....."
Everyone’s a victim. Holy moly.
okay why is derrick even here deadass. “involuntarily celibate.” says a LOT  lmfao.
"The National NOW Family Law Advisory Ad Hoc Committee, trying to ""work in promoting justice and equality for women"" had been formed in April 2004, so at 16:39 that guy was kinda wrong objectively."
All the women are emotionally abusive and they should not have any decisions making
"Derek is an incel, not a mens rights activist. Awful job Jubilee"
"and yet in many cases when a boy asks a girl and she refuses, she either gets k1lled or rap3d."
Fatherless behaviour
i've never watched someone embarrass themselves as hard as derrick did this video lol
Jubilee quite literally cut him out of the video. Kursat actually said a lot more than what Jubilee presented and at one point told him to stop bringing statistics into it.
 @riven4121  really? what did he tell the other MRA's when they were saying men are biologically worse parents than women?
"The feminists in the video didn't say anything in support of men. Men don't want these women's help. 

Kursat destroyed that woman."
​ @regisglass5464  why are you so obsessed with men being parents?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's strange, you don't believe the MRAs saying men are lesser is misandry?"
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv that's strange. Did you not see the video that you are unaware of what it contains? Kindly do so, but thank you for accepting that the MRAs seeing men as lesser parents is misandry."
​ @regisglass5464  why are you so keen for people to agree with feminists/feminism?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  that's an odd response. You mean seeing men and women as equal parents is inherently feminist to the point it forces people to agree with feminism?
​ @regisglass5464  why do you want people to agree with feminism? Just answer the question.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus my question. Again, you mean seeing men and women as equals parents forces people to be feminists? Do you state as such because the MRAs see men as lesser parents?"
​ @regisglass5464  they don't see men as lesser parents.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's odd, have you not seen the video? Kindly do so, but thank you for accepting said position is sexist."
​ @regisglass5464  where did they specifically say that men are inferior parents?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  do you believe men and women are equal parents?
​ @regisglass5464  they are different.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and as the MRAs say men are lesser parents, is that the different you mean? Again, kindly watch the video (or at least the first question), but thank you for accepting said position is sexist"
"​​ @regisglass5464  it isn't sexist. Women are better caregivers. Just as saying that men are physically stronger than women isn't sexist  

If women aren't better caregivers, why do they dominate caretaker jobs?"
​ @regisglass5464  I didn't say that they're better parents.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  certainly you (and the MRAs) did. And again, thank you for accepting that is a sexist position. Or who is more likely to win custody, the parent that's the better caregiver or the parent that is not?"
"​ @regisglass5464  it should be on an individual basis. 

However, please explain why women aren't better caregivers on average. I want your reasoning."
"​ @regisglass5464  it should be on an individual basis. However, I never said that men are worse parents"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  certainly you did. Again, as you (and the MRAs) view men as biologically worse parents, who is more likely to win child custody when judged on an individual basis? 
And yes, thank you for admitting said view is sexist."
" @regisglass5464  it's judged on an individual basis. However, because of the feminist/anti-male court system, women are often given custody instead of men.

Why do women get more lenient sentences for the same crimes than men do?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  and thus my query. as you (and MRAs) state men are biologically worse parents, who is more likely to win child custody? Note you already accepted it is done on an individual basis."
Wdym?
Like him giving statements in a more rationale manner doesn't mean its never debunked lmao
He did. Jubilee scrubbed him out. He actually recorded the whole thing secretly.
​ @riven4121  did he disagree with the other MRAs stating women belong at home because men are biologically worse parents? Or what other things did he say?
 @riven4121  Got a link?
What did derrick say that you found relatable?
 @regisglass5464  dude is pretty relatable.
 @QWERTY-gp8fd  but what did he say?
 @regisglass5464  it seems youtube is deleting my comments.
" @QWERTY-gp8fd  it happens when YouTube thinks you're a bot, ie, copy pasting commentz"
 @regisglass5464  anyways he is relatable cuz he inkwell. thats it.
 @QWERTY-gp8fd  he's relatable because he uses ink? that's an odd response
" @regisglass5464 no. he is inkwell. 
which is type of men. not someone who uses ink. im a virgin and look very closely at my face.
that should give you enough info to know what is inkwell.
 and i will continue using the term inkwell as a substitution for avoid youtube comment deletion."
 @QWERTY-gp8fd  that's a strange response. You consider ink to be a type of metrosexual male?
 @regisglass5464   u are dense. no inkwells are the type of males as you can clearly guess just by looking at my face. its a subsitution word for that starts with i and finish with l.  i am the opposite of stereotypical chad.
" @QWERTY-gp8fd  if you think I'm wrong, just write the definition of metrosexual"
 @regisglass5464 3:36 honestly.
Then give them support? Instead of whining about it do something.
they made another video about him lol check it out
so does that mean his points are invalid?
What different views from the MRAs did he hold?
Put feminist men vs antifeminist women
Derrick was insufferable . He’s composing tha5 no women want him when he doesn’t have basic respect for them
Derrick is a keyboard warrior
This whole video is a reason why Derrick is an incel advocate
Just one name?
Why is rhe fay girl so rude?
Women blaming everybody and everything except themselves. No responsibility taken.
"kursat is goat, these feminists are over their head 🤣"
Comments section is a huge disappointment
Definition of Feminazi? Answer: 13:45
"I dunno whether this comment is visible to anyone or not
but i just wanna say, it's coming
the end is coming, not too far ahead is the term Maculinists"
Men have it hard. Women have it hard. Men need women and women need men. That simple.
Her personal experience has nothing to do with not having rights under the law. That's a victim mindset for her personal experiences and generalizing it to All men. She needs therapy.
Dis Derrick is crazy 💀
The women: 😱🥹                                                     The men:😐😐😐
"As a woman, I am so proud of the Feminist side! They all spoke with such confidence and logic. A lot of these debates seem to showcase extremist on both sides. Honestly, I’m proud of the men too. Men’s rights is something I tend to scoff at, but they were respectful and I appreciate that."
"I get the point of view from being hit on in an aggressive and forceful manner, which is not ok. But what is the desired goal when fighting for that? The men that will listen and try to do something about it are not the ones treating women in that way. Yes it creates in-equality, but its more you're resonsibility to protect yourself than it is someone elses. Its also less to do with gender and more to do with size. Smaller men will face similar trials in their life, though this will be shared more amoung woman, its more representitive of the innate physical differences between men and woman."
"Red pill and feminism are two sides of the same coin; both divisive in nature.

Signed,
A woman"
"Derrick is so sad to watch, literally the definition of a Discord mod"
"Why did you have to get three of the most insel men's rights activists for this, jubilee is clearly trying to say something bro..."
"true 
everyone treats him like gum on the bottom of their shoe"
"Explain cause this don’t make no sense,"
What?
​ @CeeC_230  yes. That's what feminists do. Blame the 'patriarchy' rather than taking personal responsibility.
 @DavidW-ng5zv   You seem to be blaming feminists for everything.
What logic did the feminists use? They were terrible.
The feminist Women are just as bad as Derrick.
LIKE DO YOU NOT WANT THOSE MEN WHO TO DO THAT TO STOP DOING THAT?!!
the feminists have their problems but they still help people. none of the MRA's in the video presented anything that would ever help men.
​ @regisglass5464  where did I even mention them?
​ @DavidW-ng5zv  that's odder. You don't believe attempting to overthrow democracy would be harmful to the west?
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv ""So what if conservatives tried a coup?"" Again, why is an attempt to strip you and everyone of their rights irrelevant?
Again, why do you believe their views on the family unit influenced their attempted coup? 
As for replacement, you wrote as such. Kindly clarify it"
"​​ @regisglass5464 What rights did they try and strip? Why are you so obsessed with them?

There are far bigger issues than that. Feminism for instance. 

I never said that their views on the family unit influenced the coup. I said that feminism hates the family unit and is leading to societal collapse.

Replace them with what? What are you even taking about?"
This would be so much better with out derrik and alyesha
should have put very strong lgbtq activists as a 3rd side
Women have locker room talk too. Just sayin
Females don’t agree for shii 🤦🏾
"Men came to talk, women came to argue 😂😂

The yellow sweater guy wasn’t helping though, but he’s “young”. Need more experience."
I wish Charlie Kirk was in this room 🙏🏾
There is no such thing as toxic masculinity
You guys are so blinded by Derrick you proceed to miss the hidden legend that Kursat is.
ngl you dont have to respect everyone's opinion if its harmful. John L.
Derrick is useless.
i fear for the future of humanity
"Men are more rational, women are more emotional and I think that shows very clearly here"
I’d definitely in todays image and social law get banned💀
“Yes! And INTERSECTIONAL feminist” 😂 instantly hated her
"Men invented logic.  We invent, build and mantain everything.  Women do not.
The ""System"" is not at fault.  Always excuses."
"Derrick saying that finding a partner as a girl is easier then finding one as a boy doesn't make any sense whatsoever. When you have a partner(as long as you are not lesbian), your partner will be a guy yet he is talking like there are more girls with boyfriends then boys with girlfriends??"
Everybody’s a victim in this country 😢😅
I thought Derrick was a girl at the beginning I’m not even joking 😭😭
these women are off the subject every f time
They shouldn’t have let mimi on the show
😂
What did he say aside from saying feminism is wrong?
 @regisglass5464  he completely smoked their asses
" @theredeemedsoul  that doesn't really answer my question. What did he say aside from ""feminism is wrong"" and ""I disagree with feminism"" (paraphrasing)?"
Men have emotions too imao they are not robots.
 @CeeC_230  I never said they don’t have emotions. I just said women are MORE emotional
 @InChristWeTrust999   I think that honestly depends on the woman.
" @CeeC_230  Okay, let’s agree to disagree. I can’t be bothered to argue"
​ @CeeC_230  emotions are bad.
 @DavidW-ng5zv   Emotions are normal.
 @CeeC_230   they're bad.
" @personacrusher6281   or men want to conquer and achieve and have that drive?

Men do have the burden of performance after all."
"that's odd. wasn't a woman, Aspasia, a teacher of Socrates? Wouldn't that mean western thought was basically brought forth by a woman?"
​ @regisglass5464  she taught him rhetoric. It's a huge stretch to say that she invented Western civilisation like you claim.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  so basically the entire basis of the Socratic philosophy was taught by a woman? It seems logic actually was invented by a woman.
"​ @regisglass5464 he invented it himself, lol. She may have helped, but she certainly didn't invent it.

Men also think more with logic than vvomen do. The way you argue yourself is testament to your lack of logic."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""She may have helped""
So logical thought was created by a woman and this is what influenced Socrates is what you are saying?"
"​ @regisglass5464  it wasn't created by a vvoman, though. He had several teachers, but he was the one who invented it."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, per your words: ""She may have helped""
So again, was logical thought created by a woman and this is what influenced Socrates?"
" @regisglass5464  no, it was not created by a vvoman. Socrates, Plato and Aristotle helped create it."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  that's interesting, so you do believe Aspasia invented logic per naming all the people she taught and the students of said people?"
​ @regisglass5464  she never invented logical thought. You need to stop lying. I told you who invented it.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  per your words: ""she taught him rhetoric"". So again, is this not you stating a woman's views is the basis of western thought?"
 @regisglass5464  so you don't think that men played any role in the basis of Western thought and it was 100% created by vvomen?
 @DavidW-ux2gc  so you do think Aspasia teaching Socrates the basis of his ideas means women helped create western thought?
​ @regisglass5464  nope. Socrates and others gave birth to it.
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  ""she taught him rhetoric"" it seems you noted the basis of western thought started with a woman. Or why backtrack?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , but Aristotle and others were the basis for Western thought. She didn't invent it. You're giving her way too much credit."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""she taught him rhetoric"" and ""She may have helped"" 
Again, it seems you noted the basis of western thought started with a woman. Or why backtrack?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""she taught him rhetoric"" and ""She may have helped"" 
Again, it seems you noted the basis of western thought started with a woman. Or why backtrack?"
 @regisglass5464  but it didn't start with a vvoman. Why are you lying?
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""she taught him rhetoric"" and ""She may have helped""
Again, it seems you noted the basis of western thought started with a woman. Or why backtrack to imply that teachers don't teach?"
" @regisglass5464  so she invented Western thought? It was all her with no input from anyone else? That's a bizarre claim from you. If she was that great, why was she only a teacher?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""she taught him rhetoric"" and ""She may have helped""
Again, it seems you believe the basis of western thought started with a woman. Strange you state she was ""only"" a teacher considering Socrates was ""only"" a teacher as well."
" @regisglass5464  but Western thought came from Plato and Socrates, both being men. You claimed that men played no role in Western thought, which is absurd.

Socrates played a role, same as Plato. Do you agree? Or do you think that it was 100% her?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""she taught him rhetoric"" and ""She may have helped""
Again, it seems you believe the basis of western thought started with a woman. 
And thank you for noting the importance of her teaching it to Socrates upon backtracking on her ""only"" being a teacher."
"​ @regisglass5464 In order to be with that many vvomen, you need to be attractive."
​ @QWERTY-gp8fd thank you for being an example
​ @DavidW-ng5zv then why are incels who are attractive still complaining that they're alone?
​ @regisglass5464 There are no attractive incels. Please don't lie.
"​ @regisglass5464 There are no physically attractive incels. If they were, they wouldn't be incels.

You're simply lying."
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  ""going to the gym doesn't make you attractive on its own"" thank you for indirectly agreeing incels are physically attractive per going to the gym. or are you stating only metrosexual men date women? 
So again, as incels are physically attractive, why are they still incels?"
"​ @DavidW-ux2gc  ""going to the gym doesn't make you attractive on its own"" again, thank you for providing examples of incels still being alone despite being attractive. so if looks aren't the issue, why are they still incels? Odd you think all those at the gym are short though"
" @QWERTY-gp8fd  You are talking like if women are always perfect and can't have ""genetic defect"". You are so cruel toward your own gender, you wouldn't hold this kind of belief if you considered yourself being the ""incel""."
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  ""going to the gym doesn't make you attractive on its own"" again, thank you for noting incels are alone despite being attractive. So if looks and money aren't the issue, why are they still incels? Seems odd you believe all people at the gym are short though"
 @AbsoluteTruth-vm1zb  men do choose woman with genetic defect. woman doesnt. big difference.
 @QWERTY-gp8fd  and you are saying this is nature as well ?
Oh hey it’s Derrick!
"Hello Derrick, I really appreciate your work. Many people, even men, don't have the courage to speak up and defend their rights. Your comitement and honestly brings respect."
Derrick really is an incel hey💔
"this woman saying harmful jokes leads to violence against women, so in that case is she like the christian radicals who want to ban violent video games, movies, and rap music? because that content cannot be allowed because those ideals willFORCE individuals to loose free will."
This didn’t accomplish anything…
"Min 5:16.... Did understanding don on that woman that fast?

I don't need you to protect me, I need you to not harm me.... stutters and realizes these are one and the same. 😊"
Virgins v Skanks: Dawn of Lame Debates
Derrick.
"This is what happen when fatherless boys idealize their deadbeat absent fathers, who they sometimes turn into victims. ""My dad hasn't around because he couldnt"" as oppose to ""because he didnt want to."""
W asian guy and Blue shirt
Wtf is an incel advocate sopose to mean? How can you support someone to be something they have no choice over 😂
Lmao the incel saying finding a girl at all is hard
Derrick got rejected didn't he
Bruh Derek 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"As a fellow Martian, this was so insufferable that I had to leave by 4:56"
"Crazy how almost all the women said they wanted to understand the men’s prospective but the entire thing was just “listen to MY problems. We are struggling you are not, we are suffering you are not”"
Am i the only who can’t understand what the guy in blue is saying? Like he has a very strange accent
"LOL. Notice how one guy is turkish, the other is asian. Why would I expect guys who come from extremely conservative and misogynistic backgrounds to understand and empathize with women?"
the men are making sense.... as usual
why are the locker room talks so bad? these feminists say men should express themselves but also say that locker room talks are bad. those are a way for men to express themselves in a more trusted and relaxed environment. nothing wrong with men talking about women or sex and making jokes. women do almost the same!
There is always angry black victim in these types of conversations
11:00 girl dont nobody want ur number
Not necessarily true. It did show feminists help both sexes while MRAs seem to be more performative in their activism
​ @regisglass5464  but it's been established that feminism doesn't help men.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  then why did only the feminists show they help both sexes?
"​ @regisglass5464  they only helped vvomen. 

How does teaching vvomen to hate men help men and society?"
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  ""they only helped vvomen."" thank you for accepting feminists at least help women. however, again, why did the video show them helping both sexes? or why not provide a timestamp of your claim?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv   ""they only helped vvomen"" again, thank you for at least accepting feminists help women. interestingly, in your attempt to backtrack, you noted the MRA's don't help anyone, ie, ""Neither group helped men"".
thus, as we agree feminists help women while MRA's do not help men, then why does the video show feminists also help men? or do you believe seeing men and women as equals only helps women?"
 @DavidW-ng5zv this is delusional
"​ @AUGHHHHHBBG , that isn't an argument."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  bro what-
"​ @AUGHHHHHBBG  I said that you have no argument. Calling me ""delusional"" isn't an argument. 

How and why am I delusional?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  cus you refuse to believe me, a feminist, about what FEMINIST believe and rather listen to non feminist who don’t under feminism to tell you how we feel about me…"
so what you’re saying is that just because they are from somewhere means that they agree with what they are taught?
 @ely9735  they quite obviously agree with what they're taught my guy
that's odd. why are the MRA's correct in stating men are biologically worse parents?
​ @regisglass5464  MRAs didn't say that.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for agreeing the MRA's holding said position makes no sense since it harms men. 
However, as you state the MRA's do not say that, have you not seen the video?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , the MRAs didn't say that men are worse parents. I have seen the video."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  now it seems you accept MRA's harm men when stating men are biologically lesser parents. if you have seen the video, then why not quote what the MRA's state on the first prompt?"
 @regisglass5464  vvomen have been very grabby/touchy with me in bars and nightclubs over the years. They do the same.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""There's nothing wrong with locker room talk""
As you defend doing as such, thank you for showing why feminism exists."
​ @regisglass5464  what is wrong with locker room talk? Wtf is feminism going to do about it?
​ @regisglass5464  nobody talked about grabbing genitals non-consensually.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""There's nothing wrong with locker room talk""
Again , as you defend doing as such, thank you for showing why feminism exists."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  certainly they did. Thus, why did only the feminists oppose it?"
"​​​ @regisglass5464  please kindly explain why you think locker room talk from men is bad. Please list your reasons.

Please note that the feminists in the video hate men.

It's interesting how you tell me that me getting groped by vvomen in clubs isn't an issue"
"​ @regisglass5464 so why are vvomen allowed locker room talk but men aren't?

Neither you or the feminists in the video explained why it's a bad thing.

How can you oppose it?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""There's nothing wrong with locker room talk""
Per defending this, thank you for showing why feminism exists.
As for men and women non consensually groping individuals, why is it that only the feminists state this is wrong?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , but where was it stated that grabbing someone non-consensually in the video? Nobody said that. Nobody has ever defended that.

I asked you to explain why you're opposed to locker room talk. Why can't you defend your point of view?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""There's nothing wrong with locker room talk""
Again, per defending this, thank you for showing why feminism exists.
Per men and women non consensually groping individuals, why is it that only the feminists state this is wrong? Why do you avoid this query?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , please state why you're against locker room talk.

Nobody defended non-consensually grabbing anyone. You just made that up. I have never seen anyone say that it was okay to do so."
" @DavidW-ng5zv   ""There's nothing wrong with locker room talk""
Per defending this, thank you for showing why feminism exists. So again, per individuals non consensually groping, why is it that only the feminists state this is wrong?"
"​ @regisglass5464 Who said anything about non-consensually groping? Nobody defended it.

Show me one example where the MRAs defended non-consensually groping. Who even spoke about non-consensually groping in the first place?

Use a timestamp."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""There's nothing wrong with locker room talk""
Again, per defending this, thank you for showing why feminism exists. So per individuals non consensually groping, why is it that only the feminists state this is wrong? Is this not showing why feminism exists?"
"​ @regisglass5464  how exactly is feminism going to prevent people from groping others?

You still haven't answered my question: Why are you against locker rook talk?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""There's nothing wrong with locker room talk""
Again, per defending this, thank you for showing why feminism exists. As you believe it impossible to stop individuals non consensually groping, thank you for showing why feminism helps people and why they're the only that do so."
"​​ @regisglass5464  so tell me, what exactly do you think that feminism is going to do to prevent people from getting groped?

You still haven't answered my question in regards to why you think that locker room talk is bad.

Can you kindly define what locker room talk is?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv   ""There's nothing wrong with locker room talk""
Again, per defending this, thank you for showing why feminism exists. As you believe it impossible to stop individuals non consensually groping, thank you for showing why feminism helps people and why they're the only that do so.
As for what they'll do, probably the same thing they did when they stigmatized domestic abuse."
"​​​ @regisglass5464  and yet domestic violence still exists. Groping people is also stigmatised, yet it still happens. Feminism doesn’t provide any solutions. 

You haven't even explained what you think that locker room talk is."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""Groping people is also stigmatised, yet it still happens.""
correct, thank you for agreeing feminism stigmatized domestic abuse and groping. Does this mean quite a lot was stopped? 

And per noting as well as defending it, thank you for showing why feminism persists. For example, ""There's nothing wrong with locker room talk"". Again, thank you for showing why feminism exists and that only feminism acts against it."
" @regisglass5464  so you admit that feminism hasn't prevented domestic abuse and groping. So what is feminism going to do?

You still haven't explained what you believe 'locker room talk' to be. How can you oppose something you can't even define?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""domestic violence still exists. Groping people is also stigmatised, yet it still happens.""
Thank you for accepting that domestic abuse and groping are stigmatized and criminalized due to feminism. Again, does this mean quite a lot was stopped? 

And thank you for showing why feminism persists as it is the only one to do anything about it. Again, why is it that only feminists oppose this? For example, ""There's nothing wrong with locker room talk""."
" @regisglass5464  so then stigmatising it doesn't stop it. I asked you what would feminists do and you said that they would stigmatise it. However, as it still happens then it shows that the feminist approach is useless.

If you can't define locker room talk, then why are you opposed to it? Kindly write what you think it means."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""domestic violence still exists. Groping people is also stigmatized, yet it still happens.""
Again, thank you for accepting feminism criminalized and stigmatized these. Does this mean quite a lot of it was stopped? Or is there a reason you avoid the query?

And thank you for showing why feminism persists as it is the only one to do anything about it. Again, why is it that only feminists oppose this? Note you even wrote ""There's nothing wrong with locker room talk""."
Why should not black people have a say about their own personal experiences? Smh
Talk about OF and females taking your money over marriage

Derrick looks like a discord mod
"no way he is an incel, i would have never guessed 💀typical discord mod"
"There's a lot of ""I feel"" and ""I think"" here. All opinions no facts. Satan is winning this battle."
Derrick needs to stop talking 😭
"I don't like this nice conversations, add some fight to be more interesting."
Identifying as an incel is crazyyy
"I wish they had brought up the point that the reasons why women are so much more likely to get custody and why women are less likely to get the death penalty are still rooted in patriarchy. Custody is assigned because women are meant to be caretakers and men are meant to pursue careers in patriarchal ideology.  Women are less likely to receive the death penalty because they are perceived as the weaker sex. 

What I wish they had discussed is how feminism actively works to dismantle the systems that are also harmful to men. When expressing emotions is viewed as a feminine trait, and therefore weak, men are conditioned into expressing all difficult emotions as anger, because it is the only expression considered masculine, it harms men’s mental health as well as their ability to affectively communicate. Violence against women is often also rooted in this dynamic. 

Why is it empowering for women to dress like men, but degrading or a joke for  men to dress like women ? Again, because femininity is viewed as weak and inferior."
Ayooooo the feminists always start crying😂😂
"""I don't need you to protect me. I just need you not to harm me. I can protect myself""💀"
Hot button topic
Needing to fight for men’s rights isn’t a thing.
"Learn what ""Patriarchy"" means.  Different from ""andrarchy"".
Any better a Matriarchy?"
Bea and krsat are the only two and the remaining are 🤡
Derrick is a kid😂
this was very disappointing to watch. They didn't touch any deep point.
"""Don't hurt me, I'm capable of protecting myself"" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Yo need to start a public discussion where anyone and everyone can join and discuss topics like this I would love to put my point in on this nor just for the men but even for the women
"There is nothing wrong with wanting to be a masculine m an.

Why shouldn't m en pursue careers? They have the burden of performance and a m an's career/money is tied to his desirability women. M en have the burden of performance."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  I'm not saying men shouldn't pursue careers, I'm saying that women should be equally as encourage to pursue their own careers and shouldn't be assumed to be the primary caretaker. If both women and men build their careers in equal ratios, that pressure for men to perform would also become irrelevant."
" @jkgymnast49  that will never change, though.

Again, m en's desirability is heavily tied to their earning ability/career."
Needing to fight for womens rights is also not a thing (anymore). Both genders are disadvantaged in one way or another. It would be cool to have both be exactly equal but thats just not how it works. Men and women have some fundamental differences stemming from hormones and physical attributes.
"Have your wife’s lover explain to you the unfairness in the draft, prison sentencing and divorce court systems."
The MRAs showed that emphatically
​​ @regisglass5464  who else will fight for men's rights/issues?
​ @DavidW-ng5zv  did the MRAs fight for men when they stated men are worse parents due to biology or the feminists when they stated the sexes are equals?
"​​ @regisglass5464  yes they did.

I'd much rather men fight on my side than women. Women shouldn't try and help men with their issues."
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  again, as you believe MRAs stating men are inherently worse parents is helpful, thank you for showing only feminism helps both sexes by opposing this."
Derrick was the result of being raised woman…wow
How about we pull a uno reverse and start the term toxic feminism.
What these women don't understand is the men they are referring to about being emotional with not getting a number or worrying about wearing something and getting attacked. Them men are 100 percent raised by single mothers.
all i'm going to say is i hate derrick
Derrick showing those feminist who's boss 💪
"Extremely weak discussion compared to many others I’ve seen on this channel and that’s mainly because of the ridiculously young boys who were chosen for this panel. The incel was just a lost kid. Not one topic has been analyzed in depth. Sad, a lost opportunity."
"One thing I noticed with men who think women are bad or women are useless is that they think this way is because women in general aren't doing any thing for THEM, women are useless to THEM not that they don't objectively serve a purpose to their workplace or their own friends or society as a whole. That women aren't doing any thing for THEM therefore they don't have value. It probably goes a bit deeper then this but I think this has a lot to do with it. Mothers don't count as typical women to them because I think they are taking care of them and raising them and then they think that they should in a way be mothered by other women."
mimi and derrick are insufferable
Derrick the goat
Derrick was very obnoxious
introducing yourself as an incel is crazy lmao
"If feminists believed in equality, they’d be arguing that abortion is a PARENT’S choice, not a woman’s choice. But on top of that, they’re also fine with fathers being forced to pay for a “woman’s choice”."
The panel selection here for men's activism sucked
Women didn’t want to vote
"When they were talking about being equal, that doesn’t mean equal in every aspect and men and women can all do things at an equal capacity. It’s talking about value. Because the problem is not that men and women are seen as different, it’s that they’re seen as unequal, women being the inferior sex in the eyes of a system built by men and perpetuated by a wider society due to their unfortunate influence. Men and women are DIFFERENT and they are created to be able to provide and contribute DIFFERENT things to a community, to enable survival, and to facilitate growth and success of the community. One may merely survive without the other, but they will not THRIVE without one another. But that means that each have qualities of equal value to bring to the table that both parties need for that success that everyone benefits from equally."
Naaaaah Derrick should nawt be in this video
Why would you think of Marxism when you think of feminism?why?just why?😂😂😂
IM A PROUD WHITE MALE
"Bro, I stopped listening to this the moment Derrick sat down with his goofy ahh voice 💀"
I feel they chose the wrong 3 guys wtf LOL
Still won the argument lol.
"​ @regisglass5464 , the MRAs didn't say that. Please don't lie.

Do you think that feminism teaching vvomen to hate men is helpful? For instance, feminism claims that vvomen are oppressed by men, thus causing resentment."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for noting it is misandry to say men are lesser parents to women. please watch the video to note the MRA's stating men are lesser parents in the first prompt
"​ @regisglass5464  they didn't say that. They never said that men are worse parents. 

However, you even conceded that vvomen are more nurturing."
"​ @regisglass5464 , but they never said that men are worse parents. 

However, please explain why vvomen make up the vast majority of those in care positions. 

Thank you for admitting that feminists hate men."
"​ @regisglass5464 , you've admitted to hating men in the past.

It's telling how you didn't answer previous questions regarding care work."
"​ @regisglass5464 , neither group cares for or helps men."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  thank you for thus showing why feminism exists. for example, why do the MRA's say men are inherently lesser parents?"
" @regisglass5464  they didn't say that. Show a timestamp if so.

Why does feminism teach vvomen to hate men and see them as their enemy?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  that's odd. have you not seen the video? kindly note their answers during the first prompt. 
But thank you for noting it is harmful to men that they act as such. why is it harmful for feminism to oppose said view?"
"​ @regisglass5464  show the timestamp. I have seen the video.

It is also interesting how you can't answer my question regarding why vvomen are the vast majority of those in care jobs if they're not more nurturing"
" @regisglass5464  feminism argues that men are oppressors of vvomen, thus teaching vvomen to hate men and see them as their enemy. This is harmful.

I have seen the first prompt and they did not say that. Please do not lie."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""neither group helps men"" thank you for noting MRA's seem to harm men. as for feminists helping men, again, did you not see the video or why state seeing men and women as equal parents harm men?"
"​ @regisglass5464  so then why does feminism teach vvomen to hate men by telling them that they are oppressed by men?

Please note that neither group helps men."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  we already agreed the MRAs harm men and that feminists help women. As for feminists helping men, again, why would seeing men and women as, for example, equal parents harm men?"
Okay?
"but it is wrong to be a white supremacist, correct?"
" @psychoxalexx  Yes, aren't you proud of your race too?"
"15:58 she dismisses what the men say yet when he asked her a question to understand what she means she accuses him of doing what she has been doing to him and men. This is ridiculous, the level of solipsism is unmatched. These women are misandrists"
"16:55  ""i didnt come with a list my dude"" lmfao i like this chick"
LOOOOVED MIMI. I agree with almost ALL her points
Jubilee knew damn well what they were doing when choosing Derick to represent men
Derrick get out
"Girl saying I don’t need you to protect me, I can protect myself. Like lady he didn’t say you couldn’t she was ALREADY looking for a fight🙄"
derrick goofy
Men run with facts. Women go with feels so there’s no point
"Lol, Derrick is so out of his league 😂 I'm no feminist, nor a mra; but the only one I can unequivocally go ""lol sthu"" is with him.

Bea and Alyshea are the most even handed feminists on their panel"
Funny how men can openly say “we are the superior gender” and if a woman says it’s just aggressive banter - despite legit studies proving women are intellectually and emotionally wayyyyy better
I would love this 3 girls vs andrew tate bwhahahaha

IM SORRY BUT DERRICK😭
She was terrible.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  why was she terrible ? 😂
"​ @HoneydewHelen  go from 16:32. She was made to look silly.

She had no argument."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  so because she didn't name an organization means she was terrible? her points are spot on throughout the whole video and she portrays what feminism actually is. (equality, not the destruction of men). The only reason all those men are in that video is because they've got no idea what feminism actually is and are ""fighting"" back because they believe feminism means the destruction of men."
"disagree with that, incels exist"
​ @lesdaisydoo  what is an incel?
Intellectually? No.
"@@JudahGoldman well seems like you have been banned from all internet sourses to see it, unfortunatly."
​ @pihu1785  most geniuses are men.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  no most oppressors are men and geniuses don’t oppress
They would lose
of course you do...
Why are the feminists so angry? 😂
Women are telling men how to speak when they are in the locker roorm.  Wow!
"A woman decides what is ""Toxic Masulinity""?"
That one woman is giving toxic vibes
18:10 please stop talking
how tf is it easir for a women to find a relasionship if theres a guy in the relationship too
Brother invite me
They threw an incel in there on purpose smh
"They took this kid just to make men look bad, let's be honest."
Future single mothers.
derrick is so condescending
Feminism technically means bith rights for men 😢 i think first jubilee should know the real meaning of feminism lol 😂
"The way the girl said she feels when she hears about men’s rights activism is the same as I feel when I hear about feminism, when I hear the word “patriarchy” it’s just boils my blood also. I guess we are more equal than I imagined 😂"
Why they gotta put an incel with the men! Gives is such a bad name!
WHAT IS THIS FILTER YUCK! ARE WE USING RETREICA IN 2024?!?
these guys are missing and not saying all the important and convincing facts. Yapping sesh
"Definitely misguided. When you're mad simply because men want better advocacy and empathy then YOU are the issue, and a hypocrite"
derick isn't as bad as andrew tate
None of the women ever listen
Why they got a virgin in here bro he ruined it
She genuinely thinks men are in locker rooms talking about how much we want to rape women then laughing about it.
No. Men use the term as well.
​ @lornam1142  even though it's a nonsense term.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  How is it nonsense? It’s pretty self explanatory. It’s forms of masculinity that are toxic.
Women have access to dating apps.
 @notmyproblewm  so? Women get hundreds of likes/matches.
" @notmyproblewm  only the top 5-10% of men.

A ll w omen get hundreds of likes/matches."
"​ @notmyproblewm  that has nothing to do with it.

W omen are just far more selective."
​ @notmyproblewm I actually forgot 70% of people in dating apps are men
 @regisglass5464  that's not relevant. W omen are just far more picky.
"​ @regisglass5464 No, I don't believe that...

Who do you think controls the dating market and are the s exual choosers?"
"​​ @DavidW-ux2gc ​​​​​​​​​  Thus my question. As you state men can't choose, does this mean they can't give consent, ie, are raped? 
Again, thank you for accepting women are just as selective as men, ie, roughly half the populace chooses to be with the other half. Or again, is 70% of the global population only men?

As you now state only top men ""get women"", then why are incels who are rich and work out still incels? 

Thank you for accepting women are forced not to have ""flings"", ie, tinder, per abortion being illegal. Or why do you pretend roe v Wade wasn't repealed?"
"​​​​​ @regisglass5464  wtf are you talking about? M en do consent. W omen are just the choosers, whilst m en are the suitors. W omen do the selecting. 

Show me evidence that m en are just as selective as w omen.

Where are the inkwells who are rich and workout? Show me. I don't believe you.

Abortion isn't illegal. You've literally just admitted that w omen are the selectors."
 @DavidW-ux2gc  hah these are just gold diggers :(
 @DavidW-ng5zv  nah I think women can also love first. Although it is less likely
 @NerdinessD  vvomen find over 80% of men below average.
" @DavidW-ux2gc  Yes, that's ture. That's becuase of the wages. I guess also that's for older women who have kids and who have less time spent in the work field."
 @DavidW-ux2gc  Everyone wants to rich these days. I think gold diggers are horrible people. I disagree with the alpha male philosophy that successful men can have multiple women. That's disgusting.
" @NerdinessD  Why? VVomen throw themselves at winners in life and want the best genes possible. They are happy to share the top m en.

So what if everyone wants to be rich?"
 @NerdinessD  what is because of the wages?
 @DavidW-ux2gc  amount of work they done bro. Men can do more work then women on average in physical things especially.
" @NerdinessD  obviously. However, part of the wage gap is due to m en having the burden of performance. They realise that their wealth is tied to their attractiveness."
​ @NerdinessD  your reading comprehension skills are abysmal.
"​ @NerdinessD  and remove it from m en and see how the world goes down.

M en aren't useless, despite what feminism claims.

Like it or not, a man's career and earnings are linked to his attractiveness."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  sure I might be. Stop your statement that women only get wealth from attractiveness.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  I mean you think women in all work fields are useless???
"​ @NerdinessD No, vvomen use less dating apps because they have more option irl and are the s*xual selectors. M en need to use them because most of them have zero options. 

VVomen already have options irl."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  zero option you mean loneliness??? Yeah so you saying it's normal for a women to be picky.
​ @NerdinessD  obviously vvomen are far more picky.
"​ @NerdinessD  vvomen resort to OnlyFans because they know it's easy money.

M en's career and money is tied to their attractiveness. VVomen's isn't."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  yeah that's easy money, not gonna lie they exist but that just a very very tiny part of the population."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  I wanna ask one question. DO you want a world without feminism? I mean I wanna know the advantages and disadvantages of it. You can discuss with me.
​ @NerdinessD  okay. So what if they're a tiny portion of the population? It still exists as a choice for women.
"​ @NerdinessD we're not 50/50 in population. There are more m en than vvomen.

You're talking about past feminism. Modern feminism teaches vvomen to hate men and see them as enemies."
​ @NerdinessD  do you agree that a man's money and career add to his attractiveness?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  51/49 ok. That's not much difference. So yaeh I know you agree with past feminism
​ @NerdinessD  people like that Regis Glass are the reason why so many dislike modern feminism.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  Yeah also incels are hated because of andrew tate and his clones. We should look for the problems in both sides and listen to both so we can find solutions that are fair.
​ @NerdinessD  what do inkwells have to do with Andrew Tate?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  what you mean inkwells?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  I am saying both the extreme feminist and the opposite side are saying non-sense things,"
​ @NerdinessD  incels. What do they have to do with Andrew Tate?
​ @NerdinessD  feminism is nonsense.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  It make sense at first. Now not very. But I think it still should exist.
yeah but modern feminism kind of leans more towards women's rights and as you can see these women aren't exactly into the whole men's rights thing
"Pretty much. The feminists even defended men's rights more than the MRAs, which was kind of weird. I mean only the feminists as a whole thought men and women were equals."
"​ @regisglass5464  men and women aren't equals, though."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  then why did only feminists defend rights for both sexes? for example, who did MRAs state are worse parents?"
"Yeah, the MRAs were pretty weird"
"​ @regisglass5464 , why did you deflect? I asked you why it's okay that feminism is one of the reasons for Western collapse, and you brought up something entirely unrelated."
"​​ @regisglass5464  I didn't say that they were feminists. However, feminism seeks to destroy the family unit and is one of the main reasons for societal collapse. Overthrowing the Capitol is a symptom, not the cause of societal collapse."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  excellent, thank you for agreeing that conservatives tried to destroy democracy and are not feminists. However, please explain why you believe conservative views on the family led to them attempting a coup."
" @regisglass5464  stop strawmanning. Why is feminism trying to destroy the family unit? This is far more harmful than a coup, which happened years ago..."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  yet you already agreed conservatives attempted a coup and state that's a symptom of their views on the family. Again, please explain this"
" @regisglass5464  If you want to go around spreading lies about me, I'm more than happy to meet you in person and we can discuss it there."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  certainly you did. Per your words: ""the attempted coup is a symptom of a collapsing society"". 
If you wish to backtrack on stating the family unit is the main reason for the collapse of the west, then i thank you for doing so."
"​ @regisglass5464  but I never said that the attempted coup is causing societal collapse. I said that it's a symptom of a collapsing society. Your reading comprehension is truly terrible.

You don't think that a strong family unit is important for society?"
"​​​ @DavidW-ng5zv  you are entitled to backtrack. However, per your words: ""the attempted coup is a symptom of a collapsing society"". 
Seems strange you believe that conservatives attempted a coup due to their views on the family unit yet also state it is not one of the main ""symptoms of a collapsing society""."
"​​ @regisglass5464  do you know what a symptom is? Genuine question.

It is a symptom of a collapsing society. However, feminism is a bigger issue in societal collapse."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  precisely, you stated the conservatives attempting a coup was a symptom of a bigger issue, ie, their views on the family unit. Thus, why try to backtrack from this?"
​ @regisglass5464  what are the conservatives views on the family unit?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for accepting they instigated a coup and that this was influenced over their views on the family unit. Did they hold your same fear over the family unit changing?
"​ @regisglass5464 , please explain what you think their view on the family unit is. Did they say what their view on it was?

It's very strange that you brought up the coup in the first place, given how I was originally talking about how feminism is partly leading to societal collapse"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's odd. If you are writing about societal collapse, why try to backtrack after writing: ""the attempted coup is a symptom of a collapsing society""?
Again, why not write what view conservatives have on the family unit that you state it influenced said symptom of a collapsing society?"
probably because he wants to be andrew tate (without the prison stuff).
" @regisglass5464  No, I find his yt channel. He lost a lot of weight over the years and he's no longer an incel. Dude actually changed."
 @regisglass5464  based on what? Inkwells hate Andrew Tate.
" @DavidW-ux2gc  i assure you, inkwells are not sentient"
 @regisglass5464  then what are they? Inkwells hate Tate.
" @DavidW-ux2gc  apologies, are you unaware of what inkwells are?"
" @regisglass5464  an inkwell is a m an who cannot get l aid. Do you know what an inkwell is? If so, why do you shame them?"
 @DavidW-ux2gc  that is a very odd response. how can an inkwell be shamed for not obtaining aid from tate?
" @regisglass5464  you are shaming inkwells because they cannot get l aid, thus fuelling their already low self-esteem."
 @DavidW-ux2gc  that's an odder response. how can i shame an inkwell for not receiving aid from tate? please explain as inkwells are not sentient
" @regisglass5464  I didn't say that they were not receiving aid from Andrew Tate. I said that you were shaming inkwells for not having sex/getting L aid. They don't even like Tate.

Do you have a source to prove that inkwells are not sentient? Please provide it if so. Is it peer-reviewed?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  now this is even more baffling. why do you believe inkwells are sentient and i shame them for not wanting to have sex with andrew tate? 
""you were shaming inkwells for not having sex/getting L aid. They don't even like Tate."""
" @DavidW-ux2gc  apologies, but you were very clear in your words. ""you were shaming inkwells for not having sex/getting L aid. They don't even like Tate"". 
Truly baffling you state non sentient object are being shamed for not wanting to have sex with tate, and i request you provide evidence showing inkwells are sentient."
" @regisglass5464  but you are shaming inkwells for not having sex as you are saying that because they cannot get sex they do not have sentience.

You were the one that said that inkwells are not sentient. YOU need to provide evidence to back up your claim. If you make a claim you need to back it up."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  as you wrote: ""you were shaming inkwells for not having sex/getting L aid. They don't even like Tate"". 
Truly baffling you state non sentient objects are being shamed for not wanting to have sex with Tate. Again, i request you provide evidence showing inkwells are sentient"
" @regisglass5464  inkwells are human males, therefore they are sentient.

Why do you think that inkwells are objects? Give your reasons."
" @regisglass5464  if inkwells are not human or sentient, then what are they? You made the claim that they're non-sentient, so show evidence. Whoever makes the claim needs to provide evidence. That is how it works.

Inkwells are m en who cannot get laid. The fact that you call them ""non-sentient/non-human"" is shaming."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  again, per your words: ""you were shaming inkwells for not having sex/getting L aid. They don't even like Tate"". 
Again, kindly provide a source showing inkwells are sentient and are being shamed for not wanting to have sex with Tate.
Odd you avoid this."
" @regisglass5464  the burden of proof is on you. You claimed that inkwells weren't human/sentient, so you need to show evidence. I told you that they are human males, so they are in fact sentient.

Inkwells are simply men who cannot get sex. You saying that that they are non-sentient IS shaming them."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  on the contrary, per your words: ""you were shaming inkwells for not having sex/getting L aid. They don't even like Tate"". 
Again, kindly provide a source showing inkwells are sentient, ie, human males, and are being shamed for not wanting to have sex with Tate."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's strange. Why do you now change the subject to incels? 
Note your words: ""you were shaming inkwells for not having sex/getting L aid. They don't even like Tate"". 
Again, please provide evidence showing inkwells are sentient men who are being shamed for not sleeping with Tate."
"​​ @DavidW-ng5zv that's quite odd. Why do you believe inkwells are not only sentient but also incels?
Note your words: ""you were shaming inkwells for not having sex/getting L aid. They don't even like Tate""."
" @regisglass5464  inkwells are another word for incels on the internet. A nickname.

You were the one that said that incels are non-sentient. Where is your evidence?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""inkwells are another word for incels on the internet. A nickname.""
kindly provide proof that is so, or are you simply trying to change the subject?"
"​ @regisglass5464 inkwells are a nickname for incels. If not, why do they refer to themselves as such in videos and comments. It's a nickname."
" @DavidW-ng5zv   ""inkwells are another word for incels on the internet. A nickname.""
Again, kindly provide proof. Otherwise it seems you are trying to change the subject."
"​ @regisglass5464  go and look up incel and blackpill videos and look at the comments. They even call them it in videos. 

Seems like you're backtracking from your claim that incels aren't sentient. 

The point still stands: Incels don't like Tate."
" @DavidW-ng5zv   ""inkwells are another word for incels on the internet. A nickname.""
Apologies, but you are deflecting. Kindly provide said proof. Or again, are you simply trying to change the subject per noting inkwells are not sentient?"
​ @regisglass5464  then why do incels call themselves inkwells in YouTube comments and on videos? It's just a nickname. I'm not sure why you're getting emotional.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""inkwells are another word for incels on the internet. A nickname.""
You are welcome to believe of me as you wish, but you are again deflecting. Kindly provide proof to your claim. Or are you trying to change the subject per noting inkwells are not sentient and incels are actually jealous of Tate?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , you are getting emotional as you can't accept that inkwell is a nickname for incel.

Why do you think that incels are jealous of Tate?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""inkwells are another word for incels on the internet. A nickname.""
You are still entitled to believe of me as you wish, but as you constantly deflect, is this because you noted you made another mistake? Do you act as such because you noted incels are actually jealous of Tate, or why not define what incel stands for?"
​ @DavidW-ux2gc Based on their sexism in comment sections and videos.
"​ @DavidW-ux2gc If you believe in freedom of speech, also believe the freedom the critizize a person anyone dislike."
"​ @NerdinessD , and what about sexism from feminists?"
​ @NerdinessD  like men can criticise the ridiculousness of modern feminism?
 @regisglass5464  explain what is inkwell if its not incel
The way you say this as you completely ignore what they have to say ☠️ what a hypocrite
​ @personacrusher6281  they said nothing of value.
" @personacrusher6281  that's what I observed in video, also personally I've experience that women take too long to come to the point or never come to the point. Also I've met few amazing women who have are amazing communicators very articulate, on the point and result oriented. I truly wish education would make most women like this."
What video did you watch? The women were way more empathetic to men than the men were to the women.
 @lornam1142   lies. The vvomen didn't care about men.
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv insecure much, go touch grass"
"I love how the gentelmen here are arguing with complete logical explainations, and the ladies keep on complaining"
The only thing I've learned from this is women are emotional and don't actually care about men's issues.
Kursat actually the debate winner here fr
I need to get on these thing holy crap dude I would debunk these women's thoughts so fast
Bea has a sexy voice
9:19
It’s crazy talk attack Derrick when dude has actual points.
calm down girls xD
There seems to be a lot of projection going on
A woman can protect herself in this society BECAUSE there are men that get paid to ensure that protection
coincidence that there is only losers there lol
Now I know why men are flying to Asia for wives
Mr.Incel just sounds angry at all times. Get over yourself boo and accept a rejection.
nooonono q tarados los chabones
Let’s touch on how Derrick said finding a girl is hard. I think he’s the only one with that problem. Dude needs to take a look in the mirror and do a reality check. Then reassess why he can’t pull
I would like to see this discussion repeated with 50+ humans.
Why does Derrick sound so animated-
E
triggered!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ha clear yourselves people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"16 and at a club, what do you expect?

sure russel whatever makes you happy
 @Lara-vo6rp facts and truth always keep me happy 😊
It's odd nearly no one here has seen the video
Nope men are the emotional one's.
" @jan6742  great argument there.. you must be very intelligent.. here's the time stamps proving my case. 

5:00 - girl is triggered by analogy snaps at the guy. 
13:53 - girls dismisses men's rights activists as ""only hearing anger"" showing zero empathy.  
14:28 - girl then instantly dismissed the idea of mens activism 
15:16 - girl gives clearly an emotional rant, starts raising voice says ""how dare you!""
16:22 - girl can't name a single feminist organization that stands up for men's rights. ""Your little research""
17:31 - ""men dont want to have open dialog about this"" well that has to be the most delusional statement I've ever heard. It's actually complete opposite.
19:18 - girls says they need to hold men accountable to teach other men about women's issues. None of the girls say that they should be educating other women on men's issues until guy called them out.
21:29 - same girl who said she doesn't understand why men need activists now calling guy out  on empathy. ""Do you have no empathy for the stories I've shared""

Sorry hun, not 1 guy got triggered in this debate. I'll wait for your time stamps proving me wrong but I already know it'll be crickets 🦗  🦗"
"​​ @jan6742 So if men are emotional and women aren't, what should be done about this?

Should men be barred from making decisions for themselves and voting as they have emotions, whilst women don't have emotions?

I'm curious to see what your solution is to men being 'emotional'.

Why did the women almost cry in this video if they are not emotional?"
 @DavidW-ng5zv  Simply control your emotions. It's not that hard. Even children learn to do this.
"​​ @jan6742 So if men are emotional and women aren't, what should be done about men? 

Do you think that men should be barred from voting? Please note that emotions are a bad thing.

Also, if women aren't emotional, why do they often cry? The ones in the video nearly cried.

And if women are logical, why do they complain about the gender pay gap and get upset about their supposed 'oppression?"
 @DavidW-ng5zv  Men should learn to control their emotions like I said. Also it would be great if men just cried instead of using violence as an emotional outlet.
 @jan6742  that's comical
Crying is better than violence🤷🏾
 @jan6742  do you believe in self defense?
"​ @jan6742  violence isn't always bad.

You also claimed that women aren't emotional."
"​ @regisglass5464  where am I wrong?

Why are you so keen for men to side with feminism?"
"​​ @regisglass5464  but people should control their emotions, particularly men.

I never backtracked.

Why are you so keen for feminists to help men?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  precisely, people should control their emotions as crying is better than committing acts of violence. thank you for thus agreeing with the feminists."
 @Russell_Russ the reason feminism talks a lot about women’s issues is because they are and have been for a long time treated unfairly
"​ @Russell_Russ    women have rarely been in war because they've been used as some sort of 'tools' instead

Why do you think they always specify ""women and children"" in times of war? Have you heard of comfort women?"
Why? Where you not watching at all?
I should get on as well and make fun of both sides.
Passport bros
No he’s not its a common problem women have extremely high standards so most men find it almost impossible to find a girlfriend
that's called war
why incel
i just want to ask that derrick has a girlfriend or not?
How Illuminati design us
THEY ARE TOO YOUNG
"Would've been great to hear from a men's right's activist who isn't a straight up misogynist. The women were giving those men the benefit of the doubt and actually trying to help them, but the men refused to hear the other side and just kept doubling down on their Reddit talking points. Just sad and pathetic. Patriarchy harms us too."
All of them were cringe
all this talk about derrick but i'm seein barely anything for the way alyesha and mimi treated zach and kursat
incel boy just sounds cringe from the get go
Derrick is literally annoying.
"As a women I saw that these chicks came with attitudes. For no reason. Calm down. 
I see what the Derik dude means he mentioned he was raised by a women only so he himself has an attitude and doesn’t know how to communicate. Take a look at the dude that said he’s raised by a single mom. Clearly women can’t do it all . And are not  equal to men ."
When I heard Derrick was an incel I ignored everything he said
If I were one of the women I already would have thrown hands a long time ago. The nerve these men have is ridiculous. I can not believe how much self control these women had not to be more angry at those men.
i hate this
The problem with believing in evolution
"what derrick wants is basicly woman to be our pet, a dog for example, we love them and care for them but we dont like it when they do stuff we dont want them to do. This is what he means with ""going back to the past wouldint be so bad"" They follow our command type stuff."
"I think it's really interesting that men's rights activists will say that women are more adept at child care and then also wonder why women get custody of children more often. You yourself are claiming that men cannot take care of a child the way a woman can, so why wouldn't the courts agree with you?"
"Men: I hear you, can you provide me an example so I can learn?

Women: Stop attacking me"
Like this if you would live in a woman only village.
"Women don't care about men's issues, period. 

5:00 - girl is triggered by analogy, snaps at the guy.

"Bro, I just looked at this before watching why is everyone hating on Derek?"
LMAO ARE U SERIOUS OFC HOMEBOY DOES NOT HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
???????
Why would they? Kursat didn't do anything and Zach had about the same views as derrick.
"average pearl fan L (btw, it’s “as a woman” not women. women is plural, woman is singular. I’m afriad you need to re-educate yourself <33 )"
"Oops. Looks  like got some errors in that comment as well. 
@fantasy-91 deep breaths. I’m 90% sure errors in the comment sections aren’t contagious."
proving his point and incels lol
​ @beganitdidnt6535  what point did he give?
​ @DavidW-ng5zv  when did he state so?
​ @DavidW-ng5zv  then you believe the point derrick gave was that women didn't give him sex? Wouldn't that show the original commenter has a point in ignoring him?
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  apologies, you deflected. Again, wouldn't that show the original commenter was correct in ignoring derrick as you state his point was that women didn't give him sex?"
The other men were actually very enlightening and calm/respectful bit Derrik 😤immediately grate my nerves with every word that came out of his mouth
"Zack got yelled at by Alysha because Zack asked her a simple question, and he was shut down."
I think you should say Derreck instead of these men
"If i were one of the men, i would of dissed, insulted and laughed at Alyesha for shutting down my explanation. I would of trolled her and said i don't see the point for feminist activists groups!!"
VVomen aren't better caregivers on average? Then why do they make up the vast majority of care positions?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's strange. if you believe (as the MRA's do) that men are biologically worse parents, then how does that help them win custody cases? isn't them losing the conclusion they should expect?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , so kindly explain why vvomen make up the vast majority of care jobs if they're not more nurturing on average?

Also, why does this bother you so much?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  why wouldn't it bother you that you view men as biologically lesser parents? But by doing so, thank you for showing why feminism exists and helps both sexes"
"​ @regisglass5464 , so then why are vvomen the vast majority of those in care jobs?

BTW, I'm also going to be a father. Why would what they said bother me?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  why would it not bother you that you see yourself as a lesser parent? Regardless, thank you for noting why feminism exists and showing how it helps both sexes"
"courts favor women over men because of bias, how do you not know this? did u pull this ""gotcha"" moment out of thin air?"
"​ @Debug-jy9yu , when do the courts favour men? VVomen get lighter sentences for the same crimes."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  do you believe men and women are equals? If not, then why should women get the same sentences as men?"
" @regisglass5464  equals in what sense? ""Equal"" is very vague.

For example, feminism argues that vvomen are above m*n."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  above men in what way? For example, if women and men are not equal, then why should they get the same prison sentences or why is there a bias in child custody cases?"
"​ @AUGHHHHHBBG , yes it does. Feminism believes that vvomen are oppressed by men."
"​ @AUGHHHHHBBG  you are not, particularly in the West.

If you believe this, then this creates resentment of men."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus my question. Again, above men in what way? If women and men are not equal, then why should they get the same prison sentences or child custody?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  If you believe you are incapable of being a loving, nurturing parent than why would a court in a custody case ? That's the point I believe regisglass is trying to make. This a perfect example of how patriarchy negatively effects men. Because of this untrue but widely held belief, male parents are losing custody of their children. Yes, science agrees that women have a biological connection with their newborn child, but that doesn't stop the father from being capable. Anyways, congratulations on being a dad ! I hope through the journey you realize you are capable of being loving and nurturing."
" @AmaraOkudoh  Regis Glass admitted to hating men, they have no argument other than that.

Why do you believe that vvomen are not more nurturing on average? Why do they make up the vast majority of those within childcare professions? Note that personality is largely genetic.

Thank you."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  that's odd. as you try to blame the feminists for what the MRA's stated, eg, that men are inherently more violent and biologically lesser at raising kids, does this mean you are indirectly agreeing with feminism? Or why not quote where the feminists state as you claim?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""If men aren't biologically more violent, why are they far more likely to be involved in violent crime?""
thank you for now demonstrating you agree with the MRA's (recall they even state men are lesser parents). as you previously tried to blame feminists for stating this and even stated this was evil, thank you for showing feminists opposing MRA's is conducive to a better society."
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv   ""If men aren't biologically more violent, why are they far more likely to be involved in violent crime?""
Again, thank you for demonstrating you agree with the MRA's and for noticing this view is harmful as you previously tried to blame feminists for stating this.
Thus, aren't you indirectly agreeing feminists help people?"
Didn't the feminist give multiple examples of her being assaulted?
"At 5:00, why do you think derrick having said women are like children is an apology; and at 15:16, why is it normal the MRA asks how and where she was assaulted that you get angry she answered? 
Isn't the fact that you are angry the feminist detailed how she was assaulted also answer 13:53, 17:31, 19:28, 21:29?
At 16:22, don't the feminists answer the question by opposing the MRA's saying men are lesser parents or why does that show MRA's should exist (14:28)?"
" @regisglass5464  15:16, ""why is it normal the MRA asks how and where she was assaulted that you get angry she answered?""
ANSWER: Your reading and listening comprehension skills need improvement. No where in my comment did I express anger so.. I did however say she was clearly angry which she even admits to.. all the guy did was ask a question and she literally flipped it to ""how dare you"" ""this is why I get angry"" and then accused him of saying that her story was ""invalid"" which he never came close to saying. So, sorry, you gotta hold the L on this one too."
" @Russell_Russ  thank you for accepting the other was asking about how and where she was assaulted. Thus, why are you angry that she then answered? Please note your answer shows as such, ie, you believe her answer is a ""rant"" even though you admit she is answering"
"​ @regisglass5464 The girl in the video should keep her emotions in check. The timestamps you gave show the feminists' hatred of men.

Please note that men should have their own movement, particularly against a hate movement (feminism)."
​ @Russell_Russ  Regis Glass is a troll.
"​​ @Russell_Russ  yeah, they always do that. Clearly not the sharpest tool in the box."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  and doesn't your comment specifically show the feminists as correct since you feel offense at her describing her assault? But thank you for accepting the feminist did answer the MRA demanding to know where and how she was assaulted.
"​​​ @Russell_Russ ""Women don't care about men's issues, period""
As stated, per you being angry at women as a whole, isn't that showing why the feminists are correct? 
Recall you already agreed the MRA wanted details about how the feminist was assaulted so it seems odd you pretended otherwise. If you wish, why not present anything the MRAs do to help men?"
"PS please note you also deflected from my queries. I will repaste them here so you may answer them:
At 5:00, why do you think derrick having said women are like children is an apology?
At 15:16, why is it normal the MRA asks how and where she was assaulted that you get angry she answered? 
Isn't the fact that you are angry the feminist detailed how she was assaulted also answer 13:53, 17:31, 19:28, 21:29?
At 16:22, don't the feminists answer the question by opposing the MRA's saying men are lesser parents or why does that show MRA's should exist (14:28)?"
 @regisglass5464  she is trying to guilt trip people into siding with her. This is emotional manipulation. If she cannot hold in her emotions then she is not suitable for a debate.
" @regisglass5464  MRAs bring attention to male issues such as homelessness, su icide, mental health, the education system and workplace fatalities. They also help to defend men against hate groups such as feminism."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  that's odd. The MRA requesting details about her assault is a guilt trip? Seems odd responding to his question is emotional manipulation. Again, isn't that showing the feminists were correct as you feel offense at the MRA having his questions answered?"
" @regisglass5464  The fact that she brought up her assault shows that she was trying to emotionally manipulate the audience into siding with her.

She got emotional. If she can't keep her emotions in check then she shouldn't be in the debate."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ​thus my question. Again, as you agree the MRA requested details about her assault, why is her answering a guilt trip? As you believe answering the MRA's question is emotional manipulation, doesn't that show the feminists were correct as you are angry the MRA was answered?"
 @regisglass5464  the fact that she even brought it up is showing that she tried to guilt trip. Why would she even bring it up in the first place? Anecdotal experience isn't helpful.
"​​ @DavidW-ux2gc per being angry to the point you now pretend the MRA demanding details is her fault, isn't that showing the feminists were correct?"
"PS and you avoided my query. Again, what have MRAs done to help men?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  should I feel bad for shitting this hard on Regis or is it deserved? I kinda feel bad, he's taking L after L but I'm glad because other people will read this and see how weak and delusional he is."
" @Russell_Russ  apologies, but you still avoid my queries. You are entitled to believe of me as you wish, but kindly answer them:
1) At 5:00, why do you think derrick saying women are like children is an apology?
2) At 15:16, why is it normal the MRA asks how and where the feminist was assaulted to the point you became angry she answered? 
3) Isn't the fact that you are angry the feminist detailed how she was assaulted also answer 13:53, 17:31, 19:28, 21:29?
4) At 16:22 don't the feminists answer the question per opposing the MRA's saying men are lesser parents, or why is the MRAs seeing men as lesser helpful (14:28)?"
"​​ @regisglass5464  she brought up her experience in the first place. That is a guilt trip.

Well, she still got angry and upset when asked to provide details. It was a simple question. 

MRAs bring attention to men's issues such as s *icide, homelessness, hypergamy, mental health, and the education system."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus, per being so angry you pretend the MRA demanding details of her assault is the feminists fault, isn't that showing the feminists were correct? Seems odd the details the MRA demanded were so terrible that you consider answering the question a guilt trip.
Likewise, what issue about men did the MRAs bring up that they didn't also sabotage?"
​ @regisglass5464  why did she bring up her assault?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus my statement (which you avoid). Per being so angry you pretend the MRA didn't demand details of her assault, isn't that showing the feminists were correct?"
​ @regisglass5464  so what if they asked details on it? Why did she even bring it up?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for accepting the MRA demanded details about her being assaulted. Thus, why is answering his question emotional manipulation?"
 @regisglass5464  how did the MRAs know about it in the first place?
" @DavidW-ux2gc  precisely, why are you so angry that you are pretending they didn't ask about it?"
" @regisglass5464  I'm not angry. What are you talking about? I rightly pointed out that if she can't keep her emotions in check then she shouldn't be in the debate.

Why did she get so upset by them asking about it?"
" @DavidW-ux2gc  certainly you are. Otherwise why pretend the MRA demanding the feminist give him details about her being assaulted is the feminists manipulating him? That's a very emotional position, or why did you get upset about her answering his question?"
" @regisglass5464  I am not angry, you are deflecting as you are arguing in emotional manner rather than sticking to the facts.

Why did she get upset about them asking about her assault? She tried to emotionally manipulate by bringing up her assault in order to gain sympathy, otherwise why did she even bring it up? If she didn't bring it up the MRAs wouldn't have asked about it as they wouldn't even have known."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  certainly you are, and i request you control yourself to answer my query. Thus, why pretend the MRA demanding details about the feminist being assaulted is the feminists fault? Why get upset over her answering his question?"
" @regisglass5464  I am not angry. The feminist got upset about being asked a simple question. Why did she even bring up the abuse story in the first place if not to guilt trip?

To answer your query: It is not her fault that she was asked (nor his), however, it was her fault that she got upset as she cannot keep her emotions under control.

Now please kindly answer mine: Why did she even bring up her experience of abuse in the first place when it was completely irrelevant?

Also, I should ask that you stop being emotional and stick to the topic at hand."
 @Russell_Russ  This Regis Glass is insane lmao. Look at what they've written.
" @DavidW-ux2gc  yah, he's embarrassing for the whole feminist cause.  I'm glad cuz people will read it and realize how delusional people like regis are."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  certainly you are, note how you pretend the MRA asking details over her being abused is the feminist doing so. Thus, why get upset that the MRA demanding details about abuse was answered? Seems odd answering this ""simple"" question brought such an emotional response from you. 
Please note, I am not insulting you. You actually are replying emotionally like the other was, eg, the other believes all women hate men and you believe answering the MRA is emotional manipulation.
Again, doesn't your comment specifically show why the feminists were correct? Kindly control yourself like the feminist did in order to answer the query."
" @Russell_Russ  you are welcome to believe of me as you wish. However, you still avoid my queries. Kindly answer them."
"​​​​​ @regisglass5464 the only one replying emotionally is you with your gaslighting. You have no logical argument. 

Why did she even bring up herself getting abused when it's irrelevant to the discussion? It was emotional manipulation on her side to get people to agree with her, that's why.

Not all women hate men, however, you certainly do and the ones in the video seem to dislike men.

The feminists were not correct in anything that they said. Feminism is a flawed ideology 

Why can't the feminist in the video control her emotions? Look at 15:16, for example. That's a very emotional response. She even admitted to being upset."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  note you continue being emotional by now stating the MRA being answered is irrelevant to the debate. Or are you upset that the feminists are shown correct by the MRA asking said question?
"​​​ @regisglass5464  I said that her bringing up her abuse is irrelevant to the debate, because it is. How did the MRA know about her abuse? Her being abused is irrelevant. 

The feminists aren't correct. She got emotional for no reason. She even admitted to getting emotional."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, kindly control your emotions in order to cease pretending the MRA asking how she was abused is unrelated to him being answered. Or are you upset that the feminists are shown correct by the MRA asking said question and receiving an answer?"
"​ @regisglass5464   why did she get upset about being asked?

I never said that she shouldn't answer. I just said that she should learn to control her emotions when going into a debate.

Now answer my question, please: Why did she bring up her abuse in the first place? This was before the MRA asked her."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for controlling your emotions in this debate and accepting the only reason the feminist brought up her abuse was because the MRA wanted details about it (though it seems odd you later state her answer was before the MRA asked it).
Regardless, as you also accept she was correct in answering the MRA's question, isn't that you agreeing the feminists have a point?"
"​​ @regisglass5464  but the feminists don't have a point. Their views are incredibly misguided.

Why did she bring up her abuse in the first place? Please kindly answe my question."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  certainly they do. As you graciously wrote: ""I never said that she shouldn't answer.""
Thus, as you agreed the MRA was answered when asking for details about her abuse and you became quite upset when she did so, isn't that you demonstrating the feminists had a point?"
"​​ @regisglass5464 so then what is their point exactly?

Why did she bring up her abuse? The MRA wouldn't have asked if she didn't mention it.

Kindly answer my question.

Nobody was upset othee than the feminist. She even admitted it."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thus your statement: ""I never said that she shouldn't answer.""
As you thus agree she answered the MRA's demand for details about her abuse and you became quite upset at her doing so, isn't that showing the feminists had a point?
And note you are still upset as you still state answering the MRA is emotionally manipulative despite him asking for details about her assault. Again, kindly control yourself as the feminist did."
"​​ @regisglass5464  why couldn't the feminist answer the question without getting emotional? Please note that she even admitted to getting emotional (angry and upset).

How did the MRA find out about her abuse in order to ask her about the abuse?"
​ @regisglass5464  how did the MRA know about her being abused?
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  precisely my statement. Again, thank you for accepting the MRA is the one that demanded details about her being abused and that you are upset she answered the question. Thus, isn't that showing the feminists had a point?"
"​​ @yournewfarther you are entitled to believe as you wish in regards to my person. However, bear in mind I did copy paste the others answers back to them so I would recommend you read the comments"
" @regisglass5464  how did the MRA know about her abuse in the first place? Is he a mind reader? Just answer the question.

You seem to be projecting/gaslighting by claiming that I am the one upset when the feminist in the video almost cried.

I'd recommend that you actually work on your reading comprehension. It's really bad. I would also kindly recommend that you stop arguing from an emotional standpoint."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  certainly you are upset. After all, you still believe the feminist answering the MRAs question is emotional manipulation. Thus, again, isn't that showing the feminist was correct?
As for why the MRA demanded how and where women are abused, I am afraid I do not know why he decided to ask as such. Thus, my other question: do you believe it correct he did so? I actually just noted you had avoided this"
 @regisglass5464  yes I am very entitled to believe in my opinion of you. Do you now why? Because you have demonstrated your gaslighting techniques countless time.
" @yournewfarther  you are entitled to believe so, but it seems odd for you to say the other gives neutral comments yet me copy pasting them means i am gas lighting.
Would this not be a double standard on your part?"
" @regisglass5464  no you are distorting their comments and saying ""thank you for agreeing with me""."
" @yournewfarther  correct, I copy pasted their comments, ie, we said the same things. Why wouldn't I thank them for agreeing with me?"
"​​ @regisglass5464 , why shouldn't the MRA ask her about it? She was the one who brought it up in the first place to try and gain sympathy. 

If she didn't want questions about her abuse, then she shouldn't have brought it up in the first place.

Nobody agrees with you."
​ @regisglass5464  why shouldn't the MRA ask where and how she was abused?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""why shouldn't the MRA ask where and how she was abused?""
excellent, thank you for accepting the MRA is the one that brought the subject to the fore. Thus, why is it correct the MRA asks said question when the answer is so terrible you think answering it is emotional manipulation?"
"​​ @regisglass5464 , why shouldn't he ask her? If it's so terrible, maybe she shouldn't have brought it up in the first place, particularly if she can't keep her emotions in check.

The fact she mentioned it in the first place shows that she tried to garner sympathy for her argument. That is emotional manipulation, frankly. If she didn't like being asked how and where, then she shouldn't have even talked about in the first place. She used it as an excuse to get emotional.

If she can't handle questions about it, then maybe she shouldn't have brought it up."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""why shouldn't the MRA ask where and how she was abused?""
Again, thank you for accepting the MRA is the one that brought up the subject. Thus, why is it correct the MRA asks said question when you agree the answer is so terrible it immediately shows the feminist has a point, ie, you become upset and believe it is emotional manipulation?"
"​​ @regisglass5464  no, the feminist brought up her abuse. How else would he know about it?

Why shouldn't he then ask her how and why when she brought it up before him? If she can't handle a simple question, then maybe she shouldn't partake in the debate if she can't control her emotions. 

If she doesn't like being questioned on it, maybe then she shouldn't ask about it.

It was emotional manipulation on her part as she tried to draw sympathy."
" @DavidW-ng5zv   ""why shouldn't the MRA ask where and how she was abused?""
again, thank you for noting the MRA brought up the subject. After all, why would answering a question be what creates the subject?
Thus, as you became quite upset when the feminist answered the MRA, ie, you agree the feminist has a point, why was the MRA correct in asking it?
Kindly try to control your emotions in the same way the feminist did, ie, she was able to answer the question."
"​​ @regisglass5464 but how did the MRA know about her abuse? Answer my question. 

The feminist doesn't have a point. The MRA should have asked it and he did.

The feminist should control her emotions. If she can't, then maybe she shouldn't be in a debate.

It's interesting how you continue to try and gaslight me despite me not being at all emotional. It shows a lack of critical thinking skills and maturity from you."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  Thus the question you avoid (per being upset): was it correct the MRA asked since you became so upset you stated the answer was emotionally manipulative, ie, noted the feminist had a point?
Again, thank you for writing the MRA was the one to bring up the subject: ""why shouldn't the MRA ask where and how she was abused?"""
"​ @regisglass5464  I told you, it was correct that the MRA asked. If she can't accept being asked and instead she gets angry and upset, then she shouldn't have brought it up. She brought it up to emotionally manipulate."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, you graciously demonstrated the MRA was the one to bring up the subject: ""why shouldn't the MRA ask where and how she was abused?""
Thus, as you became quite upset over the answer to the point you state it was emotionally manipulative, ie, you accepted the feminist had a point, why was it correct the MRA asked it? Again, kindly control your emotions in order to answer my query (as the feminist did)."
" @regisglass5464  I'm not going to reply to you after this. You have really poor reading comprehension.

For the last time: The feminist brought up her abuse in the first place. If the MRA simply asked when and where regarding it, then it is her fault that she got triggered (can't control her emotions) seeming as she was the one who brought it up.

How can the MRA be the one to bring it up? How would he know about it if she didn't say? Answer that question.

The MRA was correct to ask. The feminist did not have a point."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  you are entitled to leave, but per your words: ""why shouldn't the MRA ask where and how she was abused?""
Thus, thank you for accepting the MRA brought the subject to the fore.
So again, why is it correct that the MRA demanded details of how she was abused?
And you are demonstrating she had a point. That's why you feel emotionally manipulated per being so upset at her answer."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  seriously, the MRA brought up the subject. Go ahead and quote what they say."
" @regisglass5464  He asked how and where this harm from men was coming from after she said that ""a lot of it is coming from harm from men"". So she brought it up. Go to 15:10.

If she brings something up, she shouldn't get emotional when a response happens. She even nearly cried. Maybe in future she shouldn't partake in debates if she gets emotional."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  excellent, thank you for thus showing the MRA was the one that brought up the subject at 15:10. Or why not quote what you cut out?
Thus, as you became quite upset over her answer to the point you state it is emotional manipulation and even misquote her, isn't that because you noted the feminist had a point? 
Again, kindly control your emotions like the feminist in order to answer the query honestly"
"​​​ @regisglass5464  go to 15:10. The feminist said that harm is coming from men and the MRA asked how and where. This triggered the feminist. Why shouldn't he ask this question? If she brought it up, then she shouldn't get emotional about a question.

She also claimed that she's ""mistreated by the system"" without showing evidence."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  precisely, per your timestamp, thank you for showing the MRA brought up the subject. Thus, why was the feminist wrong in answering that you became upset upon noting she had a point?
Or again, why not quote the part you cut?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , but she brought up the subject. The time stamp shows it.

I've already quoted it. If you're too s tupid to understand then I can't help you."
"@DavidW-ng5zv  then kindly quote the part you cut out, and kindly control your emotional outbursts as there is no reason to throw insults.
So again, why was the feminist wrong in answering that you became upset upon noting she had a point?"
"​​ @regisglass5464  the feminist brought up her abuse stories in order to garner sympathy. This was wrong. She then proceeded to get emotional.

Please note that you're the only one who is using insults by accusing me of being emotional.

The feminist also claimed that women are oppressed. This is clearly wrong."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  you are entitled to believe being descriptive is insulting. But again, as you noted the MRA did bring up the subject (as per your timestamp) and became upset because the feminists' answer showed she had a point (to the point you insulted me and said the feminist was emotionally manipulative), why was the feminist wrong? Or why not quote what you cut?"
 @DavidW-ng5zv  bro should know feminism nowadays have different goals for different feminists. We can't view is as a whole. Its complex
 @DavidW-ng5zv  yes they do have point...some are useless some are not. We need to listen to each other voices
 @DavidW-ng5zv  you can't view women as a whole. When some are not oppressed some are still
"This is eye opening for me … I’m 55 . These young adults communicate like they’re in a prepubescent group circle. They lack positive experiences ( that you create on your own) and maturity… most of their gripes can simply be chalked up to life. It really isn’t complicated . The lot of them engaged in discussion about the most elementary topics that should be safely 6 - 10 years behind them , unbelievable.. boohoo. They better get a grip real soon because they’re clearly way behind the 8 ball, I wasn’t looking at competent adults and they’re running out of time. I really hope they learn focus on themselves more because to me - it looks like the world is kicking their butt !!!!"
That asian guy is so annoying
Women aren't capable of maintaining a level head....based on this video
No offense but Derrick is a joke
"I would just say that the patriarchy has harmed, both men and women. It has only helped for the rich to keep in power, and have us fighting against each other. I will also say that a lot of feminist do not want equality, but they want superiority. If they want equality, they would also understand that men are hurting too, and we are all in the same boat."
Derrick seems like a dangerous person.🤷🏼‍♀️
They picked terrible men lmaoo. Ofc toxic masculinity is real. Just not necessarily the same definition that we can agree upon.
Are these girls acustic?
Why did they let them women just beat them up .... They weren't mens rights activist they were scared
"I really feel sorry for Derrick. I emphasize with him strongly because I've had moments where I was so anxious that I wasn't capable of properly expressing my thoughts. He seems to be full of thoughts, frustration and energies that he has to let out but wasn't able to. If you ask me, his extent of suffering is probably the biggest. But the least self-confident are always the most disregarded and there's no room for people like him."
some of these guys arguments (the court system for example) make zero sense to me because those “inequalities” were established by men. not women.
the middle ground is called being equal. feminism is the support of the fight of getting to being equal
"I hate the term incel…it becomes clear in most cases that these dudes are not classified that way “involuntarily”. Bro you did that to yourself. 
AND suprise suprise, the term incel is almost exclusively given to…MEN."
All them are all d
MRAs are prior feminists who became enlightened so they’ll have more knowledge about this type of stuff
This why women can’t lead. Way too emotional. Never thinking about the overall always reflecting on what they personally went through.
"""recently"" lady... women got to vote 100 years ago. What are we some civilization that dates back 1000 of years, thats not recent at all."
They all kinda sucked
"I wonder how many feminist have ever called the police when they felt in danger or fear? Kinda destroys the argument. If they could,  then there would be no need to call the police since they are so tough and can take care of themselves"
Why don't y'all ever talk about toxic feminist.....?
Found a Derrick
What is your solution?
ru?
*acoustic(autistic)
Beat them up how?
"Because if one of the lads acted in self defense they would be locked away, whilst the women would be praised for acts of violence. I think you forgot this video is supposed to be about both groups finding a ""middle ground"", settling their differences whilst keeping their initial opinions."
But who’s helping to maintain them? It’s certainly not just men
"​ @PinocchioDread no, that one has an even more depressing answer. Turns out most custody cases are solved outside of the courtroom by men just saying they don't want to care for the children. So the MRAs saying men are inherently worse parents clearly aren't helping"
"​ @regisglass5464  women are more nurturing than men on average. 

Why are the vast majority of care jobs undertaken by women?"
 @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for being an example
"​ @regisglass5464 , thank you for not even addressing my point and instead deflecting.

Why are women the majority of those in care jobs?

Women are more nurturing."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, than you for being an example of the MRAs self sabotaging"
​ @regisglass5464  thank you for deflecting.
"​ @regisglass5464  , so you have no argument. 

It's funny how you seem to think that MRAs are court judges."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  thus I thank you for showing MRAs either self sabotage or do nothing in helping men choose to be father's.
​ @DavidW-ng5zv thank you for thus accepting the other is wrong in blaming feminism
​ @regisglass5464  it is the fault of feminism.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""it's the men's choice"" again, thank you for agreeing the other is mistaken about feminism"
​ @regisglass5464  but feminism teaches women to hate men.
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""it's the men's choice"" again, thank you for agreeing the other is mistaken about feminism"
​ @regisglass5464  then why does feminism teach women to hate men?
​ @regisglass5464  yet why does feminism teach women to hate men?
derrick was plenty emotional if you ask me 🤷
i don't understand. you mean non feminists don't call police because some women are police?
​ @regisglass5464  vvomen police officers are a liability.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  why? But thank you for noting feminists made it so both men and women protect the nation
" @regisglass5464  they're a liability because they have to lower the standards for them to join. How is a 5'2, 85lb vvoman going to tackle a full-grown ^^an?

So thank feminism for putting people in danger by allowing vvomen to join the military and police force? That's not the flex you think it is.

VVomen are a liability in these positions. Face it."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  excellent, thank you for accepting women and men protect people thanks to feminism while MRA's (such as you) state they should not.
If they're a liability, however, then why do antifeminists keep calling the police for help?"
"​ @regisglass5464  I'm not an MRA. I don't know where you got that from. I also wouldn't call the police. 

However, you've acknowledged that feminism is responsible for weakening the police force due to lowering the physical requirements for vvomen to join, thus making them a liability."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's odd, i never said you would call the police even though you are an MRA. Regardless of your deflection however, if women are a liability in police and weaken it, then why do MRA's call the police for help? 

again, thank you for accepting it is due to feminism that people are protected by men and women"
"​​ @regisglass5464 I'm not an MRA. Please do not lie.

They call the police wanting a m an to show up. They wouldn't want a vvoman officer in most cases. 

You even admitted that vvomen are a liability in the military and police force."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for thus backtracking on stating women weaken the police force per noting MRAs still call the police for help.

However, seems odd to state you are not an MRA yet you defend and explain how they think. why lie?"
"​ @DavidW-ng5zv  if you are not backtracking, then do you believe MRA's don't call the police to save them because they can do it themselves? again, thank you for noting they still demand men and women protect them

If you are not an MRA, why are you defending and defining how they think?"
"​ @regisglass5464 I don't know if they call them. Some do, and some don't. However, the feminist in the video claimed to be able to protect herself, yet would expect m*n/the police to protect her. Who would you expect to protect you more: A 6'2, 210lb m*n or a 5'4, 90lb vvoman?

I can protect myself, for instance."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""Some do, and some don't""
then as we agree MRA's request female and male police save them per their inability to do so, thank you for backtracking on stating the police are weaker.

Do you state you are not an MRA because you don't need the police to save you?"
"​ @regisglass5464 , but the vvomen recruits do make the force weaker and less effective as they need to lower the requirements to accommodate them. A force is as strong as its weakest element. 

Mimi claimed that she can protect herself, yet would expect m*n/the police to protect her.

I state that I am not an MRA because I'm not one. Please don't tell me what I am and try and gaslight me."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  and yet you stated MRAs demand the police save them because they cannot defend themselves. thus, thank you for backtracking on stating the police has become weaker.
again, is this why you state you are not an MRA despite defining and defending their views? do you not expect the police to protect you as you claim mimi does?"
​ @Maithebandit  they're largely useless and a liability
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""Some do, and some don't"" again, are you pretending not to be an MRA because you noted they need police to save them despite you stating police are now weaker? 
Or do you expect the police to not protect you as you claim mimi does?"
"​ @regisglass5464 I'm not an MRA. You're making weird accusations. 

The original comment was regarding Mimi, who claimed that she was capable of defending herself, despite the fact that she isn't."
"​​​ @DavidW-ng5zv  ""I also wouldn't call the police""
Quite frankly, it's very odd you stated you don't need police to protect you and then condemned Mimi by claiming she lied about not needing police assistance (why not provide a timestamp of this?). Even odder you define and defend what MRAs believe and state while writing you are not a MRA."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  Thus far, it seems you are being a bit emotional as it seems you are an MRA lying about not calling the police to save you when you are in trouble. Which is ironic because this is what you accuse Mimi of."
"​ @regisglass5464  I don't even know wtf you're talking about. Where have I been emotional? I said I'm not an MRA and that I don't need the police to protect me. I stated facts. Where was I emotional?

Also, it's interesting how you're trying to shame me for my supposed emotions. I thought that feminists didn't like gender stereotypes?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  you are entitled to believe i am shaming you as well as assume i am a feminist. But as for you being emotional, you again demonstrated it:

""I don't even know wtf you're talking about. Where have I been emotional? I said I'm not an MRA and that I don't need the police to protect me. I stated facts. Where was I emotional?"""
" @DavidW-ng5zv  Still quite ironic you seem to be doing the exact same thing you accuse Mimi of (though i still await your timestamp over this ""fact""). 
Either way, thank you for backtracking on police being weak per noting MRA's demand male and female officers save them because they can't save themselves."
"​ @regisglass5464 I asked you where I was emotional. Please show me where. You were the one who admitted to hating men and having an agenda (feminism).

I would appreciate it if you stopped being emotional and instead stuck to the facts presented. I am happy to engage in conversation with you, but you have to not be emotional and instead try to remain rational."
" @DavidW-ng5zv   you are entitled to believe i am as you so wish. But kindly control your emotions, eg, ""I don't even know wtf you're talking about. Where have I been emotional? I said I'm not an MRA and that I don't need the police to protect me. I stated facts. Where was I emotional?""

Still ironic you are doing the exact same thing you pretend Mimi does, but thank you for backtracking on police being weak per noting MRA's demand male and female officers save."
"​ @regisglass5464 I'm not being emotional. You're just deflecting and gaslighting. 

I said that feminism has made the police force weaker as the physical standards are lowered to accommodate vvomen. That is literally making it weaker."

We need Andrew tate in here

"Feminism is irrelevant now. Feminism is now about power over men, not equality."
Alyesha was such an instigator and kept invalidating by victimizing everything that was said remotely refuting what she said.
"I feel as if Derrick is just a sex-deprived person who takes it out on women and the fact he said im an incel is outrageous then makes the claim ""Im and incel on purpose"" wouldn't that just make him celibate? I'm probably incorrect if so can someone enlighten me more on the subject."
"“I don’t dislike men, I love sports, I play video games”. Sorry, what? You’re love of sports and video games doesn’t prove you like men 😂"

So you can’t joke because it leads to something else and playing violent video games leads to people being violent.

"Im SOOO glad I live in Florida, that feminism s*** dont fly down here!"
The black lady is having too much say because she's trying to get an apology from men who were in no way involved in her abuse.  The examples she gave are way too personal
Did you see how many times the males rolled their eyes while the women were talking? Says a lot.
next time bring a sexist
The men really did not want to see or hear what the women said. Sad.

didn't the mra's specifically ask her how and where she'd been abused?
 @regisglass5464  she got emotional over it.
 @DavidW-ux2gc  over what?
"​ @regisglass5464 over her ""experiences."" Pathetic."
 @DavidW-ng5zv  what experiences do you mean? Please be specific
​ @regisglass5464  her abuse.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  what abuses did the MRAs demand she describe?
​ @regisglass5464  does it matter? She was asked how and where the harm from men was coming from and she got emotional.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  certainly it does. You stated she was abused and the MRAs demanded she give details about it. Kindly do so so we may see her answer. Or is it so awful YouTube will block you for writing it?
"​​​ @regisglass5464 she got emotional over some tame question. She should learn to control her emotions.

If she didn't want to be asked about it, why did she bring it up?"
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's an odd deflection. What were those tame things you previously described as abuse? Or did you avoid writing it because it is so awful youtube blocks you from writing it?
Likewise, why do you believe her answering the MRA means she created the query?"
" @regisglass5464  she was the one who brought it up in the first place. If she didn't want to talk about it, why did she bring it up?

She said that she had a bottle thrown at her head lmao."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""She said that she had a bottle thrown at her head"" and what else? Kindly provide the rest.
And again, why do you believe her answering the MRA means she created his query?"
 @regisglass5464  she brought up the fact that she was abused in the first place. He asked how and when. Why did she even bring it up?
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""She said that she had a bottle thrown at her head"" apologies , but you deflected. Again, what else? Kindly provide the rest.
And again, why do you believe her answering the MRA means she created his query? Is this because you noted her answer was fairly convincing?"
" @regisglass5464  if she didn't want to answer the question, why did she bring it up in the first place?

Her answer was not convincing at all. She claimed that m en and masculinity are the issue, and he asked why she believed that."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  ""She said that she had a bottle thrown at her head"" apologies, but if her answer wasn't quite convincing, then why not write what else she said? Seems odd you avoid this.
And again, why do you believe her answering the MRA means she created his query? Do you mean it was her plan to make all the MRAs backtrack?"
"​​ @regisglass5464 , why do you want me to write out what she said? You even admitted that she had no real argument.

She got triggered by the MRA asking her a question. She should keep her emotions in check. If she can't, then she shouldn't be on the panel. Her whole argument was that m en are bad."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  ""She said that she had a bottle thrown at her head"" apologies again, but if her answer wasn't quite convincing, then why not complete what she said? Seems odd you avoid this, but thank you for noting she gave quite a bit more examples.

And again, why do you believe her answering the MRA means she created his query? Do you mean it was her plan to make all the MRAs backtrack by tricking them into asking her said question?"
​ @regisglass5464  why should i quote everything she said?
"​ @regisglass5464 , why should i quote everything she said?

She brought up her abuse, and he asked a simple question. Do you think he's a mind reader? 

Honestly, I do think you need to work on your debate skills. They're terrible."
"Says a lot when you refer to them as ""males"" and ""vvomen"".

They rolled their eyes at the ridiculous arguments."
" @DavidW-ux2gc   I agree, I don’t like that either. But I also see men online do that to women all the time and we get called “dramatic” whenever we point it out."
 @aella_1709  as modern feminism has no real arguments.
 @DavidW-ux2gc   Why do you think that?
​ @aella_1709  men and vvomen have equal rights. What exactly do feminists want?
 @DavidW-ng5zv   vvwomen? We’re not exactly equal yet. Considering the abortion laws that are currently being passed.
" @aella_1709  Yes, as youtube is leftwing and certain words will be deleted. 

You are equal. You have all of the rights."
They did
"​ @Parrallaxatives  yes, the feminists."
Are you serious 🤡
"when Zach was trying to make a point, one of the women literally lashed out at him and made him feel bad lmao what are you on about"
They said nothing of value anyway. Just talked about a patriarchy that doesn’t exist
these dudes just absolutely dumping logical fallacies out their mouth
The poor men. 🤣
Need Top G here
I wanna know if Derrick is still an incel in 2023? 😂
I wonder why he's an incel......
I think the black woman is lying about her experience of being touched in from of her husband they lie.
"“I think a lot of times when a movement is created, the other side thinks they’re being attacked”

“That’s not what feminism is about at all”

“What do you need a whole men’s rights activism movement for?” Do you not see the contradiction with what you just said? Seems like she sees the men’s movement as a threat to Feminism"
Women dont need more shita bruh
Bro just bring Andrew Tate
These women are clueless.  Many states do not tax those products.  They don't consider mens rights at all
The male cast was terrible
You're snivelling gets boring.
Fact. Single dads are better at raising children then single moms. This video is like watching a bad high school play written by high schoolers who' have only been taught by women.
"Feminists schooled the guys about toxic masculinity, I love it.

However, Derreck doesn't believe in friendship between genders because he keeps falling in love with women who are trying to be friendly because of his lack of experience and options. That's what most women get completely wrong about incels, which is crazy to me, because it is written on his face, in the way he avoids eye contact"
"gotta agree with the feminists this time, except for the toxic masculinity part"
Toxic masculinity is not real.
"These women did not only stand up for women, but also for men. And that's on equality. And i hated that Derrick guy pls get him off my screen"
I'm with the feminist in this one. Tell em girl!
"Incel, more like insecure"
"Notice how all 3 women made valid points, provided examples, listened, tried having a genuine dialogue. And everything that came out of the guys’ side was counteraction & dismissive"
Rude of you to talk about women like that.
It’s too hard to sympathize but it’s a lot easier to go ahead and pretend something that is true isn’t
You're part of the problem
​ @regisglass5464  why aren't women better caregivers?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  why would men be worse caregivers?
 @regisglass5464  due to biology.
 @DavidW-ux2gc  thank you for showing exactly why the feminists were correct.
​ @regisglass5464  yet you have no argument.
 @DavidW-ng5zv  you are entitled to pretend so
​ @regisglass5464  what even is your argument? Every comment you make is nonsensical
 @DavidW-ng5zv  you are welcome to pretend so
​​ @regisglass5464  so what is your argument?
 @DavidW-ng5zv  what does my first comment say?
​ @regisglass5464  you said that men are inferior to women. Is that your argument?
" @DavidW-ng5zv  that's interesting. You now write that the MRA's stating men are biologically bad parents is misandry (though you also seem to believe me writing they state as such is the same). Thank you for thus agreeing that men and women are equals, ie, feminism."
" @regisglass5464  men and women are different and have different strengths, therefore they are not equal by definition.

The only misandry I've experienced is from feminists. It teaches women to hate men and that men aren't needed."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  yet you noted MRA's stating men are seen as biologically lesser parents is misandry. thus, thank you for showing exactly why feminism is needed as per their misandry and misogyny."
" @regisglass5464  it isn't misandry, though. The only misandry is from feminists."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  Now you are backtracking. Thank you for accepting i did not state men are inferior to women to the point you know write that men being seen as inferior to women ""isn't misandry, though"""
" @DavidW-ux2gc  again, thank you for accepting i did not state men are inferior to women to the point you know write that men being seen as inferior to women ""isn't misandry, though"". Or are men lesser parents?"
​ @regisglass5464  you admitted that you view men as inferior to women.
"​ @regisglass5464  you literally admitted it.

The only misandry present was coming from the feminists.

Why are you so obsessed with men as parents?"
it isn't a treat to feminism men also deserve rights!
" @DavidW-ng5zv  again, thank you for accepting i did not state men are inferior to women to the point you know write that men being seen as inferior to women ""isn't misandry, though"". Or are men lesser parents as per the MRAs?"
"Derrick is already there, they are pretty much the same."
" @alex_inside  Except that they aren't. Andrew Tate isn't an incel, extremely successful, and helps others. Completely different"
"Many states DO tax those products. Saying that these women are ""clueless"" makes me suspicious."
The whole cast😅
 @DavidW-ux2gc  then why do the MRA's disagree with you?
" @regisglass5464  they don't. In fact, they're pretty vehemently against single mums."
" @DavidW-ux2gc  interestingly enough, they actually do support mom's in that they don't want men to pay alimony. so again, why do the MRA's disagree with you?"
Single dads tend to raise kids better due to financial advantages and not having the effects of pregnancy tho-
" @AUGHHHHHBBG  this is kind of true, though it may be that only those type of men decide to raise their children considering how little single dads there. it's basically like trying to see how talented men are at chess and only testing champions"
"​ @regisglass5464  maybe because the vast majority of chess champions are men, thus showing men are better overall at chess."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  interestingly enough, nearly every woman that has tried out for chess professionally has become a champion.
so how do you account the fact that 90% of men that try fail at becoming chess champions while nearly 90% of women that try do become chess champions?"
"​​ @regisglass5464  and yet the vast majority of champions have been men. Virtually no vvomen have been champions. 

Is this because men are better at chess overall?

This is the variability hypothesis."
" @DavidW-ng5zv  thank you for agreeing that whenever women decide to enter chess championships, they win. thus, as 90% of women that enter win while 90% of men that enter lose, what does that say about the original example?"
"​ @DavidW-ux2gc  again, as you graciously noted 90% of women that enter chess championships win while 90% of men that enter lose, and you now try to backtrack by pretending otherwise, is this because you noted you made a mistake?"
"""Schooled""?

She literally said ""I got raped so men shouldnt have rights advocates""

LOL"
Why? They argued terribly.
What do you even agree with?
" @DavidW-ng5zv   these are the most logical feminists i've heard, the ones who argued terribly where the men righters"
​ @valvalvalval8412  the feminists were shown to look silly when he asked for examples and she couldn't name any.
Huh?
 @lornam1142  fixed the issue
 @gsGs-xb6um  What do you think toxic masculinity refers to?
me when i lie
 @lesdaisydoo  what
He’s “incelcure” 😂
Provide an example then
